# vicchi.org

This is the source for my personal blog. Built using [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/), with a custom [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) theme and hosted on an Oracle ARM64 server in the cloud.

## Here Be Dragons

This is a personal project. It's not particularly well documented, if at all, relies on my own, opinionated, setup and relies on an [Imagor](https://github.com/cshum/imagor) CDN and my own [Feed Proxy API](https://github.com/vicchi/feed-proxy). It's very useful for me and might be useful as an example of adding limited dynamic features to a Nikola static blog, a Tailwind driven Nikola theme and/or running a Nikola blog in Docker containers. Or not.
