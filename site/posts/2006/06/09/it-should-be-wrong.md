I used to have a home made anti-stress ball, consisting of a flour filled balloon; it was made for me by one of the French students currently on industrial placement at work. I say used to as one of my colleagues managed to break it, which at least proved it really was a balloon filled with flour. Which is a shame as I was rather fond of it.

But then whilst out on a trip the self same student found this.

Looks fairly innocuous doesn't it? If you pick it up it feels slightly ... *icky*, but not alarming.

How can something so wrong be so compelling? This [video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoQKQqN28IQ "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoQKQqN28IQ")  demonstrates better than words ever can. Merci bien Roland!
