As fast as an anti-spam mechanism appears on the net, the spammers try to find a way to circumvent it; recently I wrote about the attempt of spammers to try and create realistic sounding names in an attempt to bypass spam filters with [unintentionally amusing results](/2006/03/06/do-you-know-these-people/ "/2006/03/06/do-you-know-these-people/").
