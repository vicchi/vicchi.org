I had some hardware delivery to the office this morning; nothing too spectacular, just some disks and some memory. The delivery was taken and signed for by a colleague who works in our IS department and they'd checked that the consignment contained exactly what we'd ordered and paid for.

In order to do that, they'd had to open the box which, judging by the ripped, torn and otherwise mangled top of the box was quite a challenge.

Let's just look at the top of the box in a bit more detail ...

Ahh; they obviously didn't see the easy to open tear strip on the *top of the box*, which wasn't the top of the box, if you see what I mean. Oh well.
