After running with [Fire](https://fire.sourceforge.net/ "https://fire.sourceforge.net/") as my primary IM app for the best part of a year, its finally been usurped by [Adium.](https://adiumx.com/ "https://adiumx.com/") After running the two in parallel I found I liked the cleaner interface of Adium over that of Fire. I'd tried Adium in the past and found I couldn't take an app with a cute little duck as a mascot seriously, but Adium just seems more polished than Fire and seems to be vastly more customisable.

So is it iChat or is it Adium? thanks to the [iChat AV Extra](https://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=1809 "https://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=1809"), it's almost impossible to tell.
