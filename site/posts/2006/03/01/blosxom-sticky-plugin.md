A while back when I was using [Blosxom](http://www.blosxom.com/ "http://www.blosxom.com/") to power my blog I wrote a plugin called sticky which forced given articles to appear as the most recent.

When I changed my blog over to WordPress the plugin got temporarily misplaced. The plugin is still referenced online at the [Unofficial Blosxom User Group plugin registry](http://blosxom.ookee.com/blog/plugins/registry/v2/listing.html "http://blosxom.ookee.com/blog/plugins/registry/v2/listing.html") so now it's back and can be [downloaded](/downloads/sticky.plugin "/downloads/sticky.plugin") again. It's better to give than receive apparently.
