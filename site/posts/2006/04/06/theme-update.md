I've swapped themes, at least for the time being, to the very customisable, visually gorgeous and almost perfect [Regulus](http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/projects/regulus/ "http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/projects/regulus/") theme, written by Ben Gillbanks at [Binary Moon](http://www.binarymoon.co.uk "http://www.binarymoon.co.uk").

Almost perfect? Well it does cause the [W3C validator](http://validator.w3.org/check/referer "http://validator.w3.org/check/referer") to barf slightly on the sidebar. No worry though, a small hack to **sidebar.php** and all was well again. The [diff is available](/downloads/regulus-sidebar.php.diff.txt "/downloads/regulus-sidebar.php.diff.txt") for those who are interested in this sort of thing.
