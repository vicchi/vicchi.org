I've just downloaded and installed the latest update for OS X via the Software Update utility. The update requires a system restart which isn't unexpected. What was unexpected was the second restart in the middle of the reboot sequence.

After my heart resumed something approaching its' normal rate I did what I should have done in the first place and read the [update documentation](https://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303411 "https://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303411"). If I'd done this I should have spotted the key phrase:

 *With the Mac OS X 10.4.6 system software update, PowerPC-based Macs will restart twice, instead of once, after the initial installation.*

No explanation as to why this was neccessary though.

This was also spotted, with similar cardiac effects, by todays edition of [The Register](https://www.reghardware.co.uk/2006/04/04/apple_updates_macosx/ "https://www.reghardware.co.uk/2006/04/04/apple_updates_macosx/").
