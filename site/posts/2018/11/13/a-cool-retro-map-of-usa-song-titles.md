Today's maps found on the interwebs. ![](https://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Dorotha-USA-song-map-3.jpg)  
  

This vintage-style map of the USA puts the titles of songs that mention place names onto their corresponding geographical spot. So, for example, the Beasties Boys' "No Sleep Till Brooklyn" is placed right on top of Brooklyn.
