With the benefit of hindsight, it was probably inevitable but 5 years after the location based, check in social network we know as [Gowalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gowalla "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gowalla") launched and 3 months after they were acquired by Facebook, Gowalla is no more.

Despite launching in 2007, 2 years prior to [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com "https://foursquare.com"), Gowalla never seemed to be able to capture attention from either users or from the media in quite the same way as Foursquare. The similarities were many; both social networks used location as a key facet, allowed users to check in to locations they were at or near and to share those locations with other users and other social networks. But while Foursquare's game mechanics of badges and Mayors seemed to hit the right note with users, Gowalla's ill explained and ever morphing system of virtual items, spots and trips never seemed to make sense. No-one I've ever spoken to could explain exactly what the point of Gowalla was, whilst Foursquare's mechanics were simplistic and easy to grasp.

After loosing ground to Foursquare, Gowalla tried to act less as a sole source of checkins and more as a central aggregator of the disparate checkins from itself, Foursquare, Facebook and Twitter, amongst others, but this move did little to slow Foursquare's ascendancy.

And now, 3 months after they were acquired by Facebook in December 2011, both the Gowalla smartphone app and website started to announce

> Thank you for going out with Gowalla. It was a pleasure to journey with you around the world. Download your check-ins, photos and lists here soon.


So long Gowalla. You were one of the first movers in the so called *check-in economy*. It was fun while it lasted. Only time will tell whether Foursquare's seemingly unbeatable lead will continue.

[Wikipedia's Gowalla entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gowalla "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gowalla") has the final word on the subject.

> Gowalla was a location-based social network


The past tense says it all.
