It's Friday, December 9th 2011 and I'm in the TSA security line at San Francisco International Airport. Shoes off. Belt off. Watch off. Laptop, iPad and Kindle out of my bag and into the trays.

TSA guard: "*New rules. You don't need to take your Kindle out anymore. It's small enough for us to see it on the X-Ray machine in your bag*"

Me: "*That's good; one less thing to have to take out of my bag*"

It's Thursday, March 1st 2012 and I'm in the same TSA security line at SFO. Shoes off. Belt off. Watch off. Laptop and iPad out of my bag and into the trays. Kindle ***in*** my bag. My bag goes through the X-Ray machine and I manage to avoid getting the full body scanner treatment.

TSA guard: "*Is there something electronic in your bag?*"

Me: "*Yes, my Kindle*"

TSA guard (*forcefully*): "*You know the rules. All electronic equipment needs to be out of your bag and in a tray*"

Me: "*I was told that there was the new rule that Kindle's didn't have to be in a tray*"

TSA guard: "*Who told you that*"

Me: "***You** did, in December*"

TSA guard: "*I would **never** have told you that*"

TSA ... WTF?
