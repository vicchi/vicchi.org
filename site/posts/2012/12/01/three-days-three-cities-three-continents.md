There's a saying that travel broadens the mind. It's a cliche but cliches generally come about because they're true. This week my mind has been considerably broadened, visting the Tandale slum on the outskirts of Dar es Salaam and attending and judging the Sanitation Hackathon, but more about that in a later post.

The week started in Chicago, the Windy City, which lived up to its name, being cold, windy and with crystal clear skies. It's a classic example of the American style of high rise architecture and the view from one of the meeting rooms in Nokia's offices were spectacular.

Then I was at home for just under a day. Cold, clear skies and a typical suburban London street scene, surrounded by Victorian era terraced cottages.

Then I was under a blazing sun in the capital of Tanzania. The contrast between an American city, a British city and a Tanzanian one couldn't have been more marked.

Three days, three cities, three continents and a well and truly broadened mind.
