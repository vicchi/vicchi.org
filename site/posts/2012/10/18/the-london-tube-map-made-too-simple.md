This is post number six in the ongoing [#mapgasm](/tags/mapgasm/ "/tags/mapgasm/") series of posts on maps found on the interwebs that I like. Yes, it's another map. Yes, it's another Tube map. I make no apologies for this.

A simple map is often a good map. Cutting away cartographical clutter can reveal the heart of what a map is trying to show. But sometimes you can maybe take the map pruning just a little bit too far. Take the map of the London Underground; surely one of the simplest and more effective maps there is. Surely there's not much scope for making it any simpler?

So *Hugh Grant* is Notting Hill Gate. *Dinosaurs* is South Kensington. *France* is King's Cross St. Pancras and *Wax Celebs* is Baker Street. But the meaning of *XXL* eludes me. What is it at Waterloo or Southwark stations that justifies the Extra Extra Large tag?

A tip of the hat goes to [Jonathan Raper](https://twitter.com/MadProf "https://twitter.com/MadProf") for spotting this in [Adam Lilley's](https://twitter.com/adamski1974 "https://twitter.com/adamski1974") [Tweet-stream](https://twitter.com/adamski1974/status/258459255827492864/ "https://twitter.com/adamski1974/status/258459255827492864/").
