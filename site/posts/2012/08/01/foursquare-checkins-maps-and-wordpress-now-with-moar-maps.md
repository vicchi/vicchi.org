If you're an avid Foursquare user you can already display your last checkin, visualised on a map, in the sidebar of your WordPress powered site with the [WP Quadratum](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-quadratum/ "https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-quadratum/") plugin. Foursquare, checkins and maps ... what more could you ask for? Maybe the answer is *more maps*.

Version 1.1 of the WP Quadratum plugin, which went live this morning, now has added maps. The previous versions of the plugin used [Nokia's maps](https://maps.nokia.com "https://maps.nokia.com"), because I work for Nokia's Location & Commerce group and I wanted to use the maps that I work on. But if Nokia's maps aren't the maps for you then how about [Google's](https://maps.google.com "https://maps.google.com"), or maybe [CloudMade's](https://cloudmade.com "https://cloudmade.com") [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org "https://www.openstreetmap.org") maps or perhaps [OpenLayers'](https://openlayers.org "https://openlayers.org") OpenStreetMap maps.

Thanks to the [Mapstraction](https://mapstraction.com "https://mapstraction.com") JavaScript mapping API, WP Quadratum now allows you to choose which mapping provider you'd like to see your checkins appear on. And if you don't want a map on the sidebar of your site, you can embed the checkin map in any post or page with the plugin's shortcode too.

As usual, the plugin is free to download and use, either from the official [WordPress plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-quadratum/ "https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-quadratum/") or from [GitHub](https://github.com/vicchi/wp-quadratum/ "https://github.com/vicchi/wp-quadratum/").

As a fully paid up and self confessed map geek I may be somewhat biased but surely most things can be improved with the simple addition of more maps.
