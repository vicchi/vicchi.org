Warning. This post contains a sweeping generalisation. Yes, I know that Places are not just part of today's digital maps; see the [James Fee](https://twitter.com/cageyjames "https://twitter.com/cageyjames") and [Tyler Bell](https://twitter.com/twbell "https://twitter.com/twbell") hangout *[The One Where Tyler Bell Defines Big Data](http://vtny.org/kr "http://vtny.org/kr")* as a proof point. But for the sake of this post, just assume that Places and maps are synonymous.

It's never been easier to make a map. Correction. It's never been easier to contribute to a map. Today we seem to be ~~making~~contributing to maps everywhere, even underground, or should I say Underground?

To ~~make~~contribute to a map, you used to have to be a professional map maker, with easy access to an arsenal of surveying or an industrial grade GPS.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

Then came the notion of community mapping. Be it [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/ "http://www.openstreetmap.org/"), Navteq's and Nokia's [Map Creator](http://blog.maps.nokia.com/maps-nokia-com/introducing-nokia-map-creator "http://blog.maps.nokia.com/maps-nokia-com/introducing-nokia-map-creator") or Google's [Map Maker](http://www.google.com/mapmaker "http://www.google.com/mapmaker"), anyone armed with a GPS enabled smartphone, hell, anyone without a GPS, could help make a map.

And now it seems, all you need to do to help make a map is to be somewhere unmapped with some form of internet access, be it a 3G or 4G cellular data connection, or a wifi connection. As part of the London 2012 Olympic Games, some London Underground stations (finally) got wifi access and sure enough, where wifi goes, so does mapping, even platforms on the London Underground.
