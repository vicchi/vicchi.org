Not all maps are created equal. I've always had a [soft spot](/2011/02/23/putting-the-tube-on-the-grid-a-geeked-out-cartographical-recipe/ "/2011/02/23/putting-the-tube-on-the-grid-a-geeked-out-cartographical-recipe/") for maps of the [London Underground](/2010/05/13/curiously-cartographic-creations-1-the-tourist-tube-map/ "/2010/05/13/curiously-cartographic-creations-1-the-tourist-tube-map/") network ever since I saw one on the back of an old London A-Z street map far too many years ago.

In case you hadn't noticed, London hosted the 2012 Olympic Games a few weeks ago so what could be more natural than a map of the Tube with famous Olympic athletes in the place of the more familiar and geographically correct station names. Maybe Chris Boardman instead of Swiss Cottage, Victoria Pendleton instead of St. John's Wood or Daley Thompson in place of Baker Street?

Hop over to the Transport for London web site and for between £3.99 and £49.00, the [Olympic Legends Tube Map](http://shop.tfl.gov.uk/design-collections/underground-olympic-legends-map.html "http://shop.tfl.gov.uk/design-collections/underground-olympic-legends-map.html") can be yours. I certainly want one. Huge amounts of kudos go to my darling wife for spotting this in the first place.
