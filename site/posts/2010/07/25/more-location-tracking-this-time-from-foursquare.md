Back in March of this year I wrote about [deliberately tracking my journey](/2010/03/20/deliberately-and-unexpectedly-tracking-my-journey/ "/2010/03/20/deliberately-and-unexpectedly-tracking-my-journey/") by using Google's Latitude and unexpectedly tracking the same journey by looking at the history of my Foursquare and Gowalla check-ins.

By using the history function from Google Latitude I was able to put together a quick and dirty visualisation of the locations I'd been to but my check-in history added not only the location but also the place that was at each location.

During last week's [Geo-Loco](https://geoloco.tv/ "https://geoloco.tv/") conference in San Francisco, Fred Wilson (no, not the guy from the B-52's) mentioned that you could feed your Foursquare check-in history into Google Maps and produce another quick and dirty visualisation of not only the places you'd checked into but also *where* those places were.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

Simply login to your Foursquare account and visit your feeds page at [https://foursquare.com/feeds/](https://foursquare.com/feeds/ "https://foursquare.com/feeds/") and copy the RSS check-in history link but don't click on the link. Open up Google Maps and paste in the link and add `?count=200` to the end of the URL to make Foursquare return a reasonable amount of check-ins. Hey presto, one instant map of your check-ins, which shows me that I've been checking in in the Bay Area in the USA, in and around London in the UK and in and around Berlin in Germany. Not that I didn't know this already but it's always good to see this visualised on a map.

Of course, Google Maps is a full slippy maps implementation, so I can click, drag and zoom in to see my check-ins from the Geo-Loco conference in San Francisco in the Bay Area, south through Palo Alto to San Jose.

I can also jump across the Atlantic Ocean, straight over the United Kingdom, to Berlin and see Berlin's Tegel Airport in the west and the Nokia Gate5 office in the Mitte district of the city.

With a little bit of time, effort and GIS know-how I could have probably come up with a slick animated trail of my check-ins but sometimes a quick and dirty way of seeing where I've been on a map is all that's needed.
