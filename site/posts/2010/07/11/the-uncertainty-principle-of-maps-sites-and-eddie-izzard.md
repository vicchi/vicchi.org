I should start off by saying that I don't mean mapping web sites. There's no Ovi, Yahoo!, Google or OpenStreetMap web sites in this post. No, this is a blog post about Eddie Izzard (at least slightly), Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (even more ephmerally), the (death of) RSS, maps and cartography (generally) and (in the main) web sites about maps and cartography.

A strange set of bedfellows you might think (you might also think I've been overdosing on LISP as there's way way too many parentheses in the first two paragraphs alone) ... but bear with me.

Eddie Izzard, in his [Dress To Kill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_to_Kill "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_to_Kill") stage show ("cake or death"), was musing on the way in which people perceive history and this got me to thinking about RSS. But first, this is what he said ...



> Yes, and I grew up in Europe, where the history comes from. Oh, yeah. You tear your history down, man! “30 years old, let's smash it to the floor and put a car park here!" I have seen it in stories. I saw something in a program on something in Miami, and they were saying, "We've redecorated this building to how it looked over 50 years ago!" And people were going, "No, surely not, no. No one was alive then!"

And the RSS connection? Well in 2005 [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/blog/saas/death-of-the-rss-reader/80 "https://www.zdnet.com/blog/saas/death-of-the-rss-reader/80") were predicting the death of RSS by way of the death of the RSS reader, and then last year [TechCrunch](https://www.techcrunchit.com/2009/05/05/rest-in-peace-rss/ "https://www.techcrunchit.com/2009/05/05/rest-in-peace-rss/") composed an epitaph for Really Simple Syndication saying "Rest in peace RSS. It's time to completely cut RSS off and switch to Twitter. RSS just doesn't cut it anymore".

Yet for me at least RSS is very much alive, well and part of my daily routine of news and information gathering and acquisition (which includes Twitter, but it's by no way the sole source). Sorry, went back to parentheses there; I'll try to curb this.

And under my RSS group that contains feeds from sites I've noticed and want to read again (yes I could have bookmarked them but my RSS reader, still alive and well in the form of NetNewsWire, aggregates them for me in a way that I find works) and it struck me the other day that there's a hell of a lot of maps and cartography sites alive and well.

So to Heisenberg's [Uncertainty Principle](https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A408638 "https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A408638")? That can be summed up neatly by saying that *the observer affects the observed*. So is this part of a renaissance of interest in mapping and cartography in general or are there more mapping and cartography sites out there because we're looking for them and people are responding to a perceived need? With this in mind, here's a list of sites you should probably read at least once because they show just how much variety and interest there is on the topic of maps out there on the web.
