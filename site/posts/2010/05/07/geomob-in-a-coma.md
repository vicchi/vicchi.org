To paraphrase both Douglas Copland and The Smiths, [Geomob](https://gmdlondon.ning.com "https://gmdlondon.ning.com"), the highly successful mobile/geo/location/place fuelled meetup for geographers, both latent and professional is on hold. Possibly permanently. As [Chris Osborne](https://twitter.com/osbornec "https://twitter.com/osbornec"), the founder and organiser, said in an email to all members of the group:



> After a wonderful couple of years doing geomob, and the people powered success that was WhereCampEU, I'm afraid to say that I am stepping down to make way for some new blood.
> 
> That does mean that there is an opportunity for one or more of you to step up and continue geomob in the spirit it started - free, non corporate, disrespectful and focused on people doing things.
> 
> Get in touch if you want to take on the mantle, until then geomob is on hiatus.
> 
> Its been a blast

As both Chris and I found out, organising the [WhereCamp EU](https://wherecamp.eu "https://wherecamp.eu") event that took place in London earlier this year was an exhausting, if ultimately rewarding, task. Imagine doing that every other month?

I hope this isn't the last we hear of Geomob; it's been a major contributor to the Geo community in London and has, indeed, been a blast. It also gave me my very first Geo themed [public speaking engagement](https://www.slideshare.net/vicchi/geomob-fire-eagle "https://www.slideshare.net/vicchi/geomob-fire-eagle") and for that I'll always be both profoundly grateful and profoundly embarrased at my first stumbling efforts.

If you're thinking of taking up the role of Geomob organiser, I encourage you to do so; it's a battering, weary, exhausting and sometimes thankless task in the run up to a meetup. Then you see the audience waiting expectantly , watch the speakers, listen to the Q&A session and before you know it the evening's over in a rush; you won't regret it.
