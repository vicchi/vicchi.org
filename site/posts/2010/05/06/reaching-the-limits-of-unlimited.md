Consider for a moment the word unlimited; it's an adjective and, if you'll pardon the condescension, it means the following:


1. not limited; unrestricted; unconfined
2. boundless; infinite; vast
3. without any qualification or exception; unconditional


Except in the world of mobile data or mobile broadband, where unlimited means, in a vaguely disturbing twisted, inverted, doublespeak sort of way, the exact opposite.

Vodafone, my current UK mobile provider, helpful tells me that I have unlimited data, subject to their [fair use policy](http://help.vodafone.co.uk/system/selfservice.controller?CMD=VIEW_ARTICLE&CONFIGURATION=1000&ARTICLE_ID=874113&PARTITION_ID=1&RELATED_ARTICLE_CLICK=1&RELATED_ARTICLE_NAME=What%20is%20Vodafone's%20fair%20usage%20policy%20for%20data? "http://help.vodafone.co.uk/system/selfservice.controller?CMD=VIEW_ARTICLE&CONFIGURATION=1000&ARTICLE_ID=874113&PARTITION_ID=1&RELATED_ARTICLE_CLICK=1&RELATED_ARTICLE_NAME=What%20is%20Vodafone's%20fair%20usage%20policy%20for%20data?") which promptly redefines unlimited as very much limited indeed and your limit is 5GB per month. That's a *lot* of data. Even being the compulsive photo uploader, web browser, Foursquare and Gowalla check in, Twitter and Facebook poster and checker that I am, I'm hard pressed to go above 500MB per month let alone 5GB.

So I was both vastly amused and somewhat shocked when this text arrived on my iPhone on the way home from work last night.

A quick call to Vodafone luckily cleared this up as being a glitch in their billing systems and I would not, as stated be charged, nor had I gotten anywhere near the 5GB limit of unlimited.

I found the whole process rather amusing in hindsight but shouldn't the mobile companies either come clean about what unlimited really means or just don't sell unlimited data as a concept at all and just sell a, 5GB in my case, data limit?
