Way, way back in the deep dark past, Autumn 2009 to be precise, myself and [several](http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/geobabble-football-blinded-by-the-light/ "http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/geobabble-football-blinded-by-the-light/") [other](http://www.cloudsourced.com/2010/05/18/2015-today-my-agi-foresight-stud/ "http://www.cloudsourced.com/2010/05/18/2015-today-my-agi-foresight-stud/") people with an opinion on matters geo were asked to contribute a paper towards the [Association for Geographic Information's](http://www.agi.org.uk/ "http://www.agi.org.uk/") [2015 Foresight Study](http://www.agi.org.uk/foresight/ "http://www.agi.org.uk/foresight/").



> The geographic information industry is undergoing radical change. Stimulated by technology and social developments, the balance of power between existing and new players is shifting. Government policy is also undergoing transformation with the publication of the UK Location Strategy, INSPIRE, the Marine & Coastal Access Bill and a new business model for Ordnance Survey. The economic strictures under which the public and private sectors will need to operate, as the UK attempts to handle enormous public debt, are also certain to drive changes in market dynamics.

In order to do so, we need to better understand what these changes are likely to be and how they will impact the geospatial industry and its customers

<!-- TEASER_END -->

Which is a nice way of saying that we were asked to look forward 5 years hence and try and predict how the UK geospatial industry would change. I had two issues with this.

Firstly, we don't have a terribly good track record for predicting how the future of a given technology will turn out ...

> "There's no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home" ... Ken Olsen, founder and CEO of DEC in 1977


... and ...

> "I think there is a world market for maybe 5 computers" ...Thomas Watson of IBM in 1943 (apocryphal)


Secondly, I have a slight issue with the phrase *geospatial industry* which, to my mind at least, conjures up images of people dealing with maps and not the geo industry as a whole, although to be fair, I'm not precisely sure *what* the geo industry actually covers but it's more than just maps.

So rather than not participating I chose to conveniently ignore the spatial specialisation an instead, attempt to play pin the tail on the (geo)donkey instead with the following paper submission:
