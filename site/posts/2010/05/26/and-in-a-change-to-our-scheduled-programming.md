For a variety of reasons I'm sadly not going to be speaking at this year's [Telematics event in Detroit](http://www.telematicsupdate.com/detroit/ "http://www.telematicsupdate.com/detroit/") in a few week's time and neither will I be at [State of the Map](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_Of_The_Map_2010 "http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_Of_The_Map_2010").

The variety of reasons are both personal and based on my departure from Yahoo! at the end of this week and that the Telematics conference is coincident with my first week with ***[redacted]***; I don't yet have a clearly articulated story with regards to ***[redacted]*** and I don't just want to retread the Yahoo! location and place story.

However I do plan to be speaking at the [Location Business Summit USA](http://www.thewherebusiness.com/locationbusinesssummitusa/ "http://www.thewherebusiness.com/locationbusinesssummitusa/") in San Jose in September and in the same month I'll be chairing the first [w3gconf](http://www.w3gconf.com/ "http://www.w3gconf.com/") in the UK. All of which provides ample scope for a modicum of geotasticness.
