In the first of this occasional series, I looked at a curiously familiar but not quite right map of the [London Underground evilly designed for tourists](/2010/05/13/curiously-cartographic-creations-1-the-tourist-tube-map/ "/2010/05/13/curiously-cartographic-creations-1-the-tourist-tube-map/"). In this second part of the series, it's time to cast out gaze out across the English Channel to Europe and how two of the member states see the European Union.

First there's how the Swedes see Europe; Britain is characterised by inventing soccer, inventing hooligans and beer (all three of which may be related) amongst others. The other European countries don't fare much better.

Heading South and slightly East is the self styled Chosen Nation of Hungary. While the descriptions are mostly one or two words, they're not that flattering. Â Britain is simply *jobs*, while other member states are characterised as *tourist hordes*, *pizza*, *last minute hotels* and *beer land*.
