I recently contributed an article to the [OpenGeoData](http://opengeodata.org/ "http://opengeodata.org/"), the blog and podcast on open maps, data and OpenStreetMap, a snippet of which is below.



> "Eddies," said Ford, "in the space-time continuum." "Ah," nodded Arthur, "is he? Is he?"
> "What?" said Ford. "Er, who," said Arthur, "is Eddy, then, exactly, then?"
> ...
> Why," he said, "is there a sofa in that field?"
> "I told you!" shouted Ford, leaping to his feet. "Eddies in the space-time continuum!"
> "And this is his sofa, is it?" asked Arthur, struggling to his feet and, he hoped, though not very optimistically, to his senses.

> Jump onto Eddy's sofa for a moment and fast forward to a possible 2015.

> After the [location wars](http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=location+war+site:techcrunch.com "http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=location+war+site:techcrunch.com") of 2010, the problems of mutually incompatible geographic identifiers have been solved with the formation of the Global Places Register. Founded by a fledgling startup on the outskirts of Bangalore, the GPR offered an open and free way for individuals and corporations to add their town, their business, their POI. All places added became part of the Global Places Translator, allowing [Yahoo's WOEIDs](http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/geoplanet/guide/concepts.html "http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/geoplanet/guide/concepts.html") to be transformed into [OpenStreetMap Ways](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Way "http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Way"), into long/lat centroids, into [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/ "http://www.geonames.org/") ids or even, for the nostalgic, [Eastings and Northings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easting_and_northing "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easting_and_northing").
