Sadly the domain [geotastic.com](https://geotastic.com "https://geotastic.com") is already taken but even so a Google search on "[gary gale geotastic](https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=gary+gale+geotastic "https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=gary+gale+geotastic")" shows [www.garygale.com](https://www.garygale.com/ "https://www.garygale.com/") as the prime hit (and we'll just conveniently gloss over the "*did you mean: gary gale egotastic*" suggestion).

And now, hot out of a FedEx package from neighborhoodies.com comes the next step in the evolution of geotasticism ... the Geotastic! hoodie!

[![Now Even Hoodies Are Geotastic!](https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4616292644_5837365f21_d.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vicchi/4616292644/ "Now Even Hoodies Are Geotastic!")

Guarantees instant geotasticness to the wearer. No, really. You saw it here first, beware of imitations.
