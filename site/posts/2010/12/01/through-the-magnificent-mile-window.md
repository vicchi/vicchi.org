By my reckoning, this is the eighth "through the window" post I've written. Mostly the view through the window is the same, day in, day out, but sometimes it gets interesting. Like this night-time view of Chicago's [Magnificent Mile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnificent_Mile "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnificent_Mile").

Taken from the window of my room on the 17th. floor of [Chicago's Intercontinental Hotel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterContinental_Chicago "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterContinental_Chicago"), this is high rise, downtown America at its best. America is always a culture clash to me and no more so than my room in the Historic Tower of the Intercontinental. This wing of the hotel is a 42 story rework of the Medinah Athletic Club, built in 1929 just before the Stock Market crash later that year. When the building was converted into a hotel, most of the original floor plans had been lost, resulting in over 175 different room layouts and sizes over the 42 floors of the building.

Of course, a building built in 1929 wouldn't really class as historic by European standards, but walking through the hotel is like stepping back in time and given the building's checkered history, I think for once the "historic" appellation is well and truly merited.
