It's been a long, exhausting, amazing, geo filled day but the first W3G conference is finally over. I'll write a more detailed post on the day later but for now, it suffices to say that it's not every day that you get to [see a phrase you coined in a blog post](/2010/04/16/the-3-ws-of-geo-and-hyperlocal-deities-and-a-pachyderm/ "/2010/04/16/the-3-ws-of-geo-and-hyperlocal-deities-and-a-pachyderm/") immortalised on the back of a conference tee-shirt

All in all, it's been a geotastic day.
