[Yanko Tsvetkov](https://alphadesigner.com/about.html "https://alphadesigner.com/about.html"), visual artist, graphic designer and illustrator, has been at it again producing more mapping madness and cartographical curiosities. The man behind the map of [Europe according to the Hungarians](/2010/05/27/curiously-cartographic-creations-2-alternative-europe-maps/ "/2010/05/27/curiously-cartographic-creations-2-alternative-europe-maps/") has produced another crop of somewhat subjective maps of Europe, where the United Kingdom comes under the headings of The Union Of Subsidized Farmers (Where I Live), Mummy (according to the USA), Slayers Of Virgins (according to France) and Enigma Code Hackers (according to Germany). Apparently.

Here's a couple of examples; Europe According To The USA ...

... and Europe According To The French.

Head over to his [mapping stereotypes project page](https://alphadesigner.com/project-mapping-stereotypes.html "https://alphadesigner.com/project-mapping-stereotypes.html") for the rest. It's mapping, but not as we know it, and as Yanko aptly puts it, "*a sense of humour is highly recommended*".
