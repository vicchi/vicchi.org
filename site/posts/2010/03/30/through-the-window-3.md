The view from the window has changed again. Last week I was deep in the Silicon Valley suburbia staying with good friends in Campbell, where the sunrises were gorgeous.

This week I'm deep in the heart of the city nicknamed *The Capital of Silicon Valley*, San Jose. The view from the window isn't nearly as appealing but it shows that the annual Geo industry extravaganza that is [Where 2.0](http://en.oreilly.com/where2010/ "http://en.oreilly.com/where2010/") is only a few days away.
