I've never run or hosted my own search engine. I've run and hosted web servers, mail servers, proxy servers and caching servers (I'm even contemplating running my own URL shortener), but never a search engine. There was a time when I ran an enterprise instance of Alta Vista back when I coded for a living and was part of the team building [Factiva.com](http://factiva.com "http://factiva.com"), but that doesn't count.

If I had have run my own search engine I would have known just how important [canonical URLs](http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=139066 "http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=139066") are and that having multiple copies of the same content hosted on different domains would cause search engines to [penalise you](http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=66359 "http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=66359") an[d loose search engine ranking](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/duplicate-content-penalty-how-to-lose-google-ranking-fast/1886/ "http://www.searchenginejournal.com/duplicate-content-penalty-how-to-lose-google-ranking-fast/1886/"), fast.

But I've never run my own search engine. So I didn't know any of this. I probably should have, but I didn't. Mea culpa.

So what has any of this to do with [Posterous](http://posterous.com/ "http://posterous.com/")? I use Posterous. I like Posterous, a lot. I've written about Posterous,Â [quite a bit](/tags/posterous/ "/tags/posterous/"). I also use Posterous to not only post to my Posterous blog but also to my own WordPress powered blog, on a domain I've owned for a goodly number of years, via Posterous's [autopost](http://posterous.com/help/autopost "http://posterous.com/help/autopost") function ... and which nicely and neatly produces an exemplar of how to have duplicate content hosted on multiple domains, with multiple URL addressing systems, for *each and every* post I produce.

How could I have not noticed this? Other people have, including [Ian Delaney](http://twitter.com/iandelaney "http://twitter.com/iandelaney")'s excellent write up, punnily entitled [Past Posterous](http://twopointouch.com/blogs/past-posterous/ "http://twopointouch.com/blogs/past-posterous/").

Sadly, it looks like despite the ease of blogging that Posterous offers, there is such a thing as *too easy* and so for now, with regret, I've postponed my use of Posterous, possibly in permanence. Unless of course, they offer a way of specifying canonical URLs.

And with profuse apologies for the overuse of alliteration in this post.
