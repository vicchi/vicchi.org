I've never been a massive fan of Crowded House but 1991's [Four Seasons in One Day](https:// "https://") could have been written with this weekend's weather in mind. We started withÂ Winter (cold, wet, miserably damp), followed by Spring (heavy showers, glorious sunshine and the odd rainbow or two), followed by Summer (clear blue skies).

Then this morning, we returned back to Winter again, complete with breath misting in front of your face, frozen puddles on the station platform and people ignoring the frozen puddles and ending up resplendently sprawled on the platform.
