I take a lot of photos, most of which end up on my [Flickr photo stream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/vicchi/ "http://www.flickr.com/photos/vicchi/"). While some of them are taken with a proper camera Â (though some would say that my [Lumix FX12](http://www.flickr.com/cameras/panasonic/dmc-fx12/ "http://www.flickr.com/cameras/panasonic/dmc-fx12/") isn't a proper camera), most of them are taken with my [iPhone](http://www.flickr.com/cameras/apple/iphone_3g/ "http://www.flickr.com/cameras/apple/iphone_3g/"), which doesn't take great pictures but takes pictures which are good enough and with the added bonus that I have it on me almost all of the time.

My photos all used to be publicly accessible and with an all rights reserved copyright on them but then I [lost my Flickr innocence](/2009/10/10/loosing-my-flickr-innocence/ "/2009/10/10/loosing-my-flickr-innocence/"), which was a bad thing at the time and switched all of my photos to friends and family visibility. About a week later, when I'd calmed down a bit, I went through all of my photo sets; photos of my family and of home stayed out of the public eye and stayed all rights reserved. But everything else, I opened up and changed the license to some rights reserved using the [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/deed.en_GB "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/deed.en_GB") license.

The reasoning behind this was that pretty much [every slide on every deck](http://www.slideshare.net/vicchi "http://www.slideshare.net/vicchi") I put together has a [background from Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/search/?&l=cc "http://www.flickr.com/search/?&l=cc") which is licensed under the Creative Commons model. Without this license and without people releasing their photos using it, my slide decks would be altogether poorer and a whole lot blander.

Opening up some of my photos under Creative Commons works both ways. In February I received a mail from someone at [Schmap](http://www.schmap.com/ "http://www.schmap.com/") telling me that two of my, Creative Commons licensed, photos had been shortlisted for including in the next edition of their London guide. Instantly suspicious of this I asked the Twitter-verse for commentary; [Vikki Chowney](http://twitter.com/vikkichowney/status/9672376118 "http://twitter.com/vikkichowney/status/9672376118"), [Lorna Brown](http://twitter.com/lornabrown/status/9672684018 "http://twitter.com/lornabrown/status/9672684018") and [Tim Moore](http://twitter.com/tjmoore/status/9673073436 "http://twitter.com/tjmoore/status/9673073436") were good enough to respond and tell me that this wasn't a scam, as my cynical mind had first surmised.

It's not much in the grand scheme of things but the people at Schmap either liked the photos I'd taken of the [Royal Festival Hall](http://www.schmap.com/london/tours_tour2/#p=486&i=486_36.jpg "http://www.schmap.com/london/tours_tour2/#p=486&i=486_36.jpg") and in [Chinatown's Tokyo Diner](http://www.schmap.com/london/restaurants_japanese/#p=111&i=111_4.jpg "http://www.schmap.com/london/restaurants_japanese/#p=111&i=111_4.jpg") (*less likely*) or didn't have any other suitable candidates and so plumped for mine (*much more likely*). Either way, this was a great example of Creative Commons in action and it allows me to continue to mine Flickr's ever growing pool of photos for my slide decks with a clear conscience.
