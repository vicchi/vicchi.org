In October of 2009 I wrote that the [trinity of geo was going to hit New York City](/2009/10/01/nyc-beware-the-trinity-of-geo-is-coming/ "/2009/10/01/nyc-beware-the-trinity-of-geo-is-coming/"). Translated, this meant that myself, [Tom Coates](https://twitter.com/tomcoates "https://twitter.com/tomcoates") (the man behind the creation of Fire Eagle and now roving Yahoo! Product Manager for User Location) and [Aaron Cope](https://twitter.com/aaronofmontreal "https://twitter.com/aaronofmontreal") (then chief geo wrangler and trouble maker at Flickr and now trouble maker at Stamen Design) were going to be descending on New York City for the [Yahoo! Open Hack](https://openhacknyc.pbworks.com/ "https://openhacknyc.pbworks.com/") developer's conference. I also speculated that is was going to be geotastic. It was.

Now some 5 months later, the video footage that was shot in the Millennium Broadway Hotel, just off of Times Square has finally emerged blinking into the light of day so now would be a suitable time to revisit my talk, *[Place not Space; There's More to Geo than just Maps](https://www.slideshare.net/vicchi/think-place-not-space-theres-more-to-geo-than-just-maps "https://www.slideshare.net/vicchi/think-place-not-space-theres-more-to-geo-than-just-maps")*.





It would also be a suitable time to pair the slide deck with added video footage featuring genuine fatigue and jetlag.
