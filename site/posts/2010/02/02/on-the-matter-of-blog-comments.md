After last week's [comments troll spat](/2010/01/29/no-comment/ "/2010/01/29/no-comment/") I decided to i) lighten up and ii) take a leaf out of the book of an author and blogger I deeply respect. So, inspired by a post on [John Scalzi's Whatever](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2009/05/17/because-flowcharts-make-everything-clearer/ "https://whatever.scalzi.com/2009/05/17/because-flowcharts-make-everything-clearer/"), I offer up a brief decision making flowchart to aid me, in future, in deciding who *does* and who *does not* get to act stroppy over comments on this blog.
