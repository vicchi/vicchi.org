Today's [social bookmarking deliciousness](http://www.delicious.com/vicchi "http://www.delicious.com/vicchi"), from down the back of the internet.


* Got a colleague who keeps wandering away from their desk and leaving their mobile phone behind, which then keeps on ringing? Maybe they need [one of these signs](http://www.flickr.com/photos/heather/50049420/ "http://www.flickr.com/photos/heather/50049420/") left on their desk. Maybe.
* Fancy a challenge? How many times a day do you type the incorrect command at the shell? Once, twice, three times a day? More? Maybe you should give [Suicide Linux](http://qntm.org/suicide "http://qntm.org/suicide") a try; it helpfully turns any mistyped command into `rm -rf /` thus helpfully erasing your root file system. Concentrate now.
* The WordPress Flickr Manager is a wonderful plugin which integrates your Flickr photostream into blog posts. Alas it doesn't work with WordPress 2.9. [Until now](http://www.workflowfaq.com/wordpress-flickr-manager-changes-for-2-9 "http://www.workflowfaq.com/wordpress-flickr-manager-changes-for-2-9").
* Posting the same article to [multiple blogs](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/duplicate-content-penalty-how-to-lose-google-ranking-fast/1886/ "http://www.searchenginejournal.com/duplicate-content-penalty-how-to-lose-google-ranking-fast/1886/") [severely impacts](http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=66359 "http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=66359") your search engine ranking results. How did I not know this? It's stopped at least [one person](http://twopointouch.com/blogs/past-posterous/ "http://twopointouch.com/blogs/past-posterous/") from using the Posterous autopost function.
* Sometimes, just sometimes, [sub-editors trim just a little bit too much](http://www.jgc.org/blog/2010/02/magic-of-sub-editors.html "http://www.jgc.org/blog/2010/02/magic-of-sub-editors.html") from an article prior to publishing.
* We're used to online slippy maps being able to zoom in and out; but zooming in and out of paper maps? [That's something else indeed](http://www.thezoomablemap.com/ "http://www.thezoomablemap.com/").
* What's happens in Vegas stays in Vegas; but [sometimes it stays on FourSquare](http://statusthis.com/2010/02/what-happens-on-foursquare/ "http://statusthis.com/2010/02/what-happens-on-foursquare/") as well.
* Photo of the year so far; the Space Shuttle Endeavour, [caught in silhouette](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1592.html "http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1592.html") from the International Space Station. That phrase alone sounds like it's been lifted wholesale from an Arthur. C. Clarke novel.
