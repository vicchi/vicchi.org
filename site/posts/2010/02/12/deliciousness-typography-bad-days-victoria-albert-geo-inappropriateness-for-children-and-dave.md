I have been remiss; it's been over 3 months since my last [Deliciousness](/tags/deliciousness/ "/tags/deliciousness/"). This needs to be remedied.* I don't usually take note of typography and font related stuff that much (leaving that to [Tom Coates](http://twitter.com/tomcoates "http://twitter.com/tomcoates") who oozes typography enthusiasm and love) but this post, on r[evisiting the font stack](http://www.awayback.com/revised-font-stack/ "http://www.awayback.com/revised-font-stack/") your blog or web site is essential reading.
* I didn't have a good day earlier this week. [Someone else](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kxjkogtqSj1qataspo1_500.png "http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kxjkogtqSj1qataspo1_500.png") felt the same way.
* The [Victoria & Albert Museum in London](http://www.vam.ac.uk/ "http://www.vam.ac.uk/")released an "[Finding Places" API](http://www.vam.ac.uk/api/#geo "http://www.vam.ac.uk/api/#geo") which allows you to discover places in their collections database.
* Difficult to tell whether this is real or not, but [Inappropriate Stuff for Kids](http://lukegregory.com/?tag=inappropriate-stuff-for-kids "http://lukegregory.com/?tag=inappropriate-stuff-for-kids") is possessed of a heavy mix of LOL/OMG/WTF-ness.
* Dave is popular; 9/10 real women prefer him. [Lucky Dave](http://hackedirl.com/2010/02/10/culture-jamming-graffiti-dave-gets-around/ "http://hackedirl.com/2010/02/10/culture-jamming-graffiti-dave-gets-around/").
* "[No wireless. Less space than a Nomad. Lame](http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/10/23/1816257&tid=107 "http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/10/23/1816257&tid=107")". In all the furore surrounding the iPad, it's easy to overlook the less than stellar reception the first iPod had.
We should do this again. Soon.
