Looking out of my hotel window I can see into the heart of Silicon Valley in Sunnyvale. What do you mean it's fairly uninspiring? East of here is Mountain View, home of the [Google-plex](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom3/494999943/ "http://www.flickr.com/photos/tom3/494999943/"), west of here is the [Yahoo! mothership](http://www.flickr.com/photos/vicchi/295565600/ "http://www.flickr.com/photos/vicchi/295565600/"), which is the reason I'm here and to the south is Cupertino, and [1 Infinite Loop](http://www.flickr.com/photos/wysz/167342533/ "http://www.flickr.com/photos/wysz/167342533/"), the home of Apple.[![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2708/4341646878_a4469924a4.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/vicchi/4341646878/ "http://www.flickr.com/photos/vicchi/4341646878/")OK, so that *is* fairly uninspiring and nondescript. This one is *much* more interesting. This is the view from my temporary cube in the middle of the Yahoo! campus, looking out over [Moffett Field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moffett_Federal_Airfield "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moffett_Federal_Airfield").[![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2680/4025905894_e39ea04400.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/vicchi/4025905894/ "http://www.flickr.com/photos/vicchi/4025905894/")That oval looking building in the middle is [Hanger One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangar_One_(Mountain_View,_California) "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangar_One_(Mountain_View,_California)") which is one of the world's largest freestanding structures. It may not look that impressive but it's almost 3 miles away; it covers 8 acres, is around 1100 feet long, around 300 feet wide and around 200 feet high. It's big.And that's a much more impressive and interesting view out of the window.
