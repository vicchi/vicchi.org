Looking out of my hotel window I can see into the heart of Silicon Valley in Sunnyvale. What do you mean it's fairly uninspiring? East of here is Mountain View, home of the [Google-plex](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tom3/494999943/ "https://www.flickr.com/photos/tom3/494999943/"), west of here is the [Yahoo! mothership](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vicchi/295565600/ "https://www.flickr.com/photos/vicchi/295565600/"), which is the reason I'm here and to the south is Cupertino, and [1 Infinite Loop](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wysz/167342533/ "https://www.flickr.com/photos/wysz/167342533/"), the home of Apple.

OK, so that *is* fairly uninspiring and nondescript. This one is *much* more interesting. This is the view from my temporary cube in the middle of the Yahoo! campus, looking out over [Moffett Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moffett_Federal_Airfield "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moffett_Federal_Airfield").

That oval looking building in the middle is [Hanger One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangar_One_(Mountain_View,_California) "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangar_One_(Mountain_View,_California)") which is one of the world's largest freestanding structures. It may not look that impressive but it's almost 3 miles away; it covers 8 acres, is around 1100 feet long, around 300 feet wide and around 200 feet high. It's big.

And that's a much more impressive and interesting view out of the window.
