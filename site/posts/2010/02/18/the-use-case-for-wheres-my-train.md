As [Paul Clarke](http://twitter.com/paul_clarke "http://twitter.com/paul_clarke") has pointed out on his blog, not [once](http://paulclarke.com/honestlyreal/2009/12/wheres-my-train/ "http://paulclarke.com/honestlyreal/2009/12/wheres-my-train/"), but [twice](http://paulclarke.com/honestlyreal/2010/01/wheres-my-train-update-13-jan/ "http://paulclarke.com/honestlyreal/2010/01/wheres-my-train-update-13-jan/"), *"I assert that train operators know where their assets are: it would be irresponsible if they didn't. And that this information is held within their internal systems*".

Here's a good use case for his proposed solution ... wheresmytrain ...

Piccadilly Circus Tube station, Bakerloo Line southbound platform, round about 5.00 PM. The dot matrix displays tell us ... that a train is "*held*" somewhere but with no information as to what this means. The platform announcer tells us "*the Bakerloo Line is currently suspended*" and immediately afterwards the "*control room*" tells us that "*a good service is currently running on all London Underground lines*".

One is these statements should be correct, the other two should not be. By means of resolution, an Elephant and Castle train turned up 2 minutes after all of this has occurred, making all three of the above statements erroneous.
