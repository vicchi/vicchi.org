There's a danger in looking at too many press releases; you can easily come to think that the view of the world that these pieces of writing portray are a fair and accurate representation of the real world.

Thus both myself and the ever readable [James Fee](https://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2010/04/17/cloudmades-openstreetmap-project-is-successful/ "https://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2010/04/17/cloudmades-openstreetmap-project-is-successful/") were vastly amused to see Michael Arrington's TechCrunch refer to [CloudMade's OpenStreetMap](https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/17/cloudmades-openstreetmap-surges-on-wikipedia-like-user-passion/ "https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/17/cloudmades-openstreetmap-surges-on-wikipedia-like-user-passion/").


<!-- TEASER_END -->

> Many people describe CloudMade’s OpenStreetMap project as “Wikipedia for maps,” and they aren’t far off. The project allows anyone to add and edit map data around the globe, and the project is now a viable open and free source of mapping data for third party developers.


Now is probably a good point to mention that [CloudMade](https://www.cloudmade.com/ "https://www.cloudmade.com/") was founded (by [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/ "https://www.openstreetmap.org/") founder Steve Coast amongst others) in 2007 and OpenStreetMap launched in 2004. Geo chicken ... meet Geo egg.

I look forward to reading about other TechCrunch exclusives including the discovery of RedHat's Linux and British Airway's airplanes.
