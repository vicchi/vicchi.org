Forgive me; it's been 5 conferences and 2 months since my last Deliciousness post and I offer this one up by way of atonement.


* Stamford Brook, Parr's Ditch, Counter's Creek ... all part of the network o[f lost rivers beneath the streets of London](https://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/284-londons-lost-rivers/ "https://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/284-londons-lost-rivers/"). I grew up next to and played in one of them, Beverley Brook, as a (very muddy) child.
* Some maps are works of art but Jason LaFerrera makes [works of art from maps](https://www.boingboing.net/2010/04/11/wildlife-made-from-c.html "https://www.boingboing.net/2010/04/11/wildlife-made-from-c.html"). No, really.
* OpenStreetMap, waze and Map Maker announce the formation of the [Closed Street Map](https://www.closedstreetmap.org/ "https://www.closedstreetmap.org/") alliance, but check out the date of the post and the [registrant's](https://twitter.com/stevec "https://twitter.com/stevec") details from the [WHOIS record](https://www.whois.net/whois/closedstreetmap.org "https://www.whois.net/whois/closedstreetmap.org") as well.
* A search for estate agents in Islington on Mountain View's [favourite search engine](https://www.google.co.uk/ "https://www.google.co.uk/") seems to say that [prisons and estate agents](https://www.malcolmcoles.co.uk/blog/google-estate-agents-criminals/ "https://www.malcolmcoles.co.uk/blog/google-estate-agents-criminals/") are one and the same.
* Forget dogs that look like their owners. Forget owners that look like their dogs. [Fonts that look like dogs](https://laughingsquid.com/fonts-that-match-the-dog/ "https://laughingsquid.com/fonts-that-match-the-dog/"), that's the thing.
* While I'm on the subject of fonts; [best alphabet](https://unrealitymag.com/index.php/2010/03/25/the-most-badass-alphabet-ever/ "https://unrealitymag.com/index.php/2010/03/25/the-most-badass-alphabet-ever/"). Ever.
* While I'm on the subject of best (ever); [best beer name](https://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,686305,00.html "https://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,686305,00.html"). Ever.
* The last time I mentioned [bacon deliciousness](/2009/10/04/deliciousness-bacon-protect-and-survive-outing-the-paleotards-fake-carol-and-crop-circles/ "/2009/10/04/deliciousness-bacon-protect-and-survive-outing-the-paleotards-fake-carol-and-crop-circles/") was October 2009 so here's a double helping. Still cooking your bacon the old fashioned way, you know, in a frying pan or under the grill? Try [wrapping it around your machine gun](https://www.geekologie.com/2010/03/its_the_american_way_cooking_b.php "https://www.geekologie.com/2010/03/its_the_american_way_cooking_b.php") for a change. You're going to be thirsty after all that cooking (and possibly that shooting) so slake your thirst with a beer, [bacon flavoured](https://lukegregory.com/?p=326 "https://lukegregory.com/?p=326") of course.
* I want this tee shirt, part one. Some days you make the coffee, [some days the coffee makes you](https://sbdc.spreadshirt.com/some-days-A5775663/customize/color/120 "https://sbdc.spreadshirt.com/some-days-A5775663/customize/color/120").
* I want this tee shirt, part two. [Nerd is the new cool](https://www.jinx.com/trs/nerd_is_the_new_cool.html?catid=1&cs=19&csd=nerd+is+the+new+cool "https://www.jinx.com/trs/nerd_is_the_new_cool.html?catid=1&cs=19&csd=nerd+is+the+new+cool") you know.
* I want this tee shirt, part three. [Bacon makes everything better](https://www.snorgtees.com/baconmakeseverythingbetter-p-757.html?osCsid=64556bb789d5d09534852f68246c96a5 "https://www.snorgtees.com/baconmakeseverythingbetter-p-757.html?osCsid=64556bb789d5d09534852f68246c96a5").
* Not much in the grand scheme of things but two of my [Flickr](https://www.schmap.com/london/tours_tour2/#p=486&i=486_36.jpg "https://www.schmap.com/london/tours_tour2/#p=486&i=486_36.jpg") [photos](https://www.schmap.com/london/restaurants_japanese/#p=111&i=111_4.jpg "https://www.schmap.com/london/restaurants_japanese/#p=111&i=111_4.jpg") made it into the 2010 London Schmap guide. This pleased me.
* Still drinking your coffee, the old fashioned way, by mouth? That's so passe. [Inhaling](https://lukegregory.com/?p=311 "https://lukegregory.com/?p=311") is the new drinking.
* Not one KitKat. Oh no. [Nineteen](https://springwise.com/food_beverage/kitkat/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+springwise+%28Springwise%29 "https://springwise.com/food_beverage/kitkat/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+springwise+%28Springwise%29") of them. In Japan only, sadly.
