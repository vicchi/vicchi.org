Each time I give my Hyperlocal or Hype (and Local) talk it morphs slightly and becomes more scathing of the term hyperlocal.

I started to write the talk for [Where 2.0 in San Jose](/2010/04/03/where-2-0-hype-or-local/ "/2010/04/03/where-2-0-hype-or-local/") earlier this year and approached it from the point of a hopeful sceptic who was looking to be persueded that the long promised hyperlocal nirvana was either right here, right now or was at least looming hopefully on the horizon.

A month later and I had the pleasure of sharing the keynote slot with Professor Danny Dorling at the [GIS Research UK conference](/2010/04/16/the-3-ws-of-geo-and-hyperlocal-deities-and-a-pachyderm/ "/2010/04/16/the-3-ws-of-geo-and-hyperlocal-deities-and-a-pachyderm/") at University College London and I revisited the theme. By this time any hope of hyperlocal nirvana had pretty much vanished.

Yesterday I took the talk out for the final time at the Location Business Summit in Amsterdam and the elephant in the room relating to hyperlocality had grown into a full blown herd of elephants.

<!-- TEASER_END -->


My scepticism was echoed by several members of the audience, notably James Thornett from the BBC who [blogged about it](https://www.jamesthornett.com/blog/2010/04/the-location-business-summit-%E2%80%93-day-1-28th-april-2010-amsterdam.php "https://www.jamesthornett.com/blog/2010/04/the-location-business-summit-%E2%80%93-day-1-28th-april-2010-amsterdam.php") and with whom I shared a panel on the nebulous concept that is the geoweb today.

But what really seemed to catch the audience's imagination was my twin memes of [Geobabel](/2010/04/21/fighting-geobabel-on-two-fronts/ "/2010/04/21/fighting-geobabel-on-two-fronts/") and the Three W's of Geo ... *the where, the when* and *the what*.

The ***where*** is what we've been doing for centuries; mapping the globe. Whilst it's a sweeping generalisation, we've pretty much done this, albeit to a varying degree of accuracy, coverage and granularity. We've mapped the globe, now it's time to do something with all of this data.

The ***when*** is the [gnarly problem of temporality](/2010/03/17/phi-lambda-and-slightly-embarassing-temporality/ "/2010/03/17/phi-lambda-and-slightly-embarassing-temporality/"), which just won't go away. Places and geography change over time; how we map a place today doesn't show how the place was 100 years ago and neither can we expect the geography of a place to be static 100 years hence. As we update our geographic data sets and throw away the old, supposedly obsolete, historical versions, we're throwing away a rich set of temporality in the process.

Then finally there's the ***what***; a reference to a place in intrinsically bound to it's granularity. References to London from outside of the United Kingdom are frequently aimed at the non specific London bounded by the M25 orbital motorway. Zoom in and London becomes Greater London, and then the London Boroughs and finally the City of London and neighbouring City of Westminster.

The strong reaction to these twin memes makes me think that we'll be seeing these topics continue to raise their heads until we're able to find work arounds or solutions.
