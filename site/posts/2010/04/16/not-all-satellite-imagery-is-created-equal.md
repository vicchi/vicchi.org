Pretty much [invisible at night](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/dprk/dprk-dark.htm "https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/dprk/dprk-dark.htm"), still officially at war with their southern neighbour and under United Nations economic sanctions, North Korea is a blank spot on political maps of the area.

Even the satellite imagery layer in Google Maps has little additional detail to offer.

But compare and contract against the updated imagery for North Korea that Google Earth has had since December of last year.

Finally add in the Google Earth layer that the [North Korea Economy Watch](https://www.nkeconwatch.com/north-korea-uncovered-google-earth/ "https://www.nkeconwatch.com/north-korea-uncovered-google-earth/") has created and all of a sudden North Korea springs into view. Ever wanted to see where the Hoeryong Essential Foodstuff Factory was located? Now you can.
