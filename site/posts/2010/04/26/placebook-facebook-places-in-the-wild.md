After much teasing and tantalising, one of the long rumoured Facebook location features is out in the wild in the form of place community pages. They vary in scale from [a hamlet in Spain](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Llonin/108139035874549?v=wiki "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Llonin/108139035874549?v=wiki") ...

... through to [New York City](https://www.facebook.com/pages/New-York-City/34228614792 "https://www.facebook.com/pages/New-York-City/34228614792").

It's clever though not particularly sophisticated at this stage; a simple exposure of Wikia's underlying geo metadata and it probably took very little effort to implement. Facebook appear to treat places as people, hence the exhortation to *connect* with the place.

For now there's very little additional geo element present though what is there is probably enough to get people to *connect with* and *like* local community places or places they already feel a connection with, their home town, neighbourhood, honeymoon spot and so on. That alone should yield valuable demographic and (geo)targetable information.

This is pretty much a classic case of Â picking low hanging fruit for Facebook and a far better exemplar of a place than the somewhat clumsy rebranding of Google's small business listings as *places,* though the [browse places page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/?browse&ps=105 "https://www.facebook.com/pages/?browse&ps=105") seems to suggest otherwise as it's very POI heavy.

It will be facinating to track how this feature of Facebook develops and matures.
