... and I'm here in the capital and largest city of the Netherlands for the first [Location Business Summit](https://www.thewherebusiness.com/locationsummit/index.shtml "https://www.thewherebusiness.com/locationsummit/index.shtml") with [Walter Andrag](https://twitter.com/andrag "https://twitter.com/andrag") and [Bob Upham](https://twitter.com/uphamb "https://twitter.com/uphamb") from [Yahoo! Geo Technologies](https://twitter.com/yahoogeo "https://twitter.com/yahoogeo") and [Anil Patel](https://twitter.com/anilpatel/ "https://twitter.com/anilpatel/") and [Chris Heilmann](https://codepo8 "https://codepo8") from [YDN](https://twitter.com/ydn "https://twitter.com/ydn"), the Yahoo! Developer Network. Another city, another hotel so this would be a good time for the obligatory through the window shot.

I'll be giving a talk on Hyperlocal or Hype (and Local)? [later on this morning](https://www.thewherebusiness.com/locationsummit/agenda.shtml#day1 "https://www.thewherebusiness.com/locationsummit/agenda.shtml#day1") and will also be on a [panel tomorrow morning](https://www.thewherebusiness.com/locationsummit/agenda.shtml#day2 "https://www.thewherebusiness.com/locationsummit/agenda.shtml#day2"), discussing how to try and monetize the growing geospatial web.Â This is the first Location Business Summit, so here's hoping it'll be geotastic.
