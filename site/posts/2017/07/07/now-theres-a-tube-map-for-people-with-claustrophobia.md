Today's maps found on the interwebs. ![](https://ift.tt/2sUH5cl)  
  

If you get anxiety or claustrophobia, there’s a new Tube map to make it easier for you to get around London. TfL just released a new map which shows which lines go into tunnels, when, and for how long, in a bid to make it easier for people to travel.
