This week's selection of what caught my eye on the interwebs:


* After managing to [acquire garygale.com](http://bit.ly/14PJLt "http://bit.ly/14PJLt") I put up a personal site on the domain and cut down the subdomain proliferation that [vicchi.org]( "") had acquired over the years, retiring blog.vicchi.org and where.vicchi.org amongst others.
* There's no accounting for taste it seems and some people think it's cute to have a [small plastic dog](http://bit.ly/19kHFB "http://bit.ly/19kHFB") humping the USB port of your laptop.
* Flavoured vodka; I can understand lemon, orange, vanilla and even chilli versions but [bacon flavoured vodka](http://bit.ly/f85Pb "http://bit.ly/f85Pb")?
* Possibly the best sign ever; "[unattended children will be fed espresso and given a puppy](http://bit.ly/ZplC6 "http://bit.ly/ZplC6")".
* In order to define recursion we must first define recursion; [Google demonstrates the principle of recursion](http://twitpic.com/bc4no "http://twitpic.com/bc4no") by offering to look up recursion when searching for recursion.
* Twitter corrected follower counts by [deleting spammer's accounts](http://bit.ly/Pkmp0 "http://bit.ly/Pkmp0"); I lost 100 followers overnight and the twitter-sphere howled in anguish.
