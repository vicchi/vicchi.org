More intriguing, interesting and just plain bonkers stuff from the information hose pipe we call the internet:


* Starting off with a serious note, [Ed Parsons](http://twitter.com/edparsons "http://twitter.com/edparsons"), my opposite number at Google, wrote a [great blog post on the knots that data licensing](http://www.edparsons.com/2009/07/time-to-reset-the-value-of-geodata/ "http://www.edparsons.com/2009/07/time-to-reset-the-value-of-geodata/") can tie you up in and why you end up paying more for a leased digital version than you do for the physical paper version.
* [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ "http://wordpress.org/") started bugging me about an auto-saved version of a blog post I didn't want to keep but couldn't get rid of. Turns out there's no way to do this from the WordPress dashboard but some [MySQL hackery](http://diggingintowordpress.com/2009/07/mastering-wordpress-post-revisioning-and-auto-save-features/ "http://diggingintowordpress.com/2009/07/mastering-wordpress-post-revisioning-and-auto-save-features/") did the trick.
* "*I am, and am VERY badly affected by being in close proximity to WiFi and other microwave transmission sources. Not that I’d expect you or anyone else who isn’t adversely affected to believe me*". The rest of the story on the [Daily Telegraph blog](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/iandouglas/100002500/why-no-one-is-allergic-to-wifi/#comments "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/iandouglas/100002500/why-no-one-is-allergic-to-wifi/#comments") is priceless.
* Ofcom confirmed what anyone with the UK ADSL line already knows, that the average UK broadband speed is [just over half](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/28/ofcom_speeds/ "http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/28/ofcom_speeds/") of what's being advertised and paid for.
* A [US highway exit sign got every word misspelled](http://www.flickr.com/photos/schilder/3757137230/ "http://www.flickr.com/photos/schilder/3757137230/"), apart from the word "exit".
* Forget putting men on Mars or getting the Space Shuttle working; [we put cheese into space](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/8171619.stm "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/8171619.stm"), tracked it, lost it and found it again. Makes you proud to be British.
* Someone likes Nutella. [A lot](http://www.zee.me/blog/2009/07/biggest-jar-of-nutella-ive-ever-seen/ "http://www.zee.me/blog/2009/07/biggest-jar-of-nutella-ive-ever-seen/").
* And finally, if your iPhone gets a [text message containing a single square character](http://mashable.com/2009/07/30/iphone-hack/ "http://mashable.com/2009/07/30/iphone-hack/"). Turn it off. Turn it off now.
