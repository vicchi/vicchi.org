* Looking for a nearby wifi hotspot? A [low tech approach](https://pics.blameitonthevoices.com/102009/small_wi-fi%20dowsing%20rod.jpg "https://pics.blameitonthevoices.com/102009/small_wi-fi%20dowsing%20rod.jpg") can help.
* Microsoft's new Windows 7 OS has inbuilt location services; but are they up to the challenge of [managing location](https://www.webmonkey.com/blog/Windows_7_Will_Let_Microsoft_Track_Your_Every_Move "https://www.webmonkey.com/blog/Windows_7_Will_Let_Microsoft_Track_Your_Every_Move") safely, securely and with sufficient flexibility?
