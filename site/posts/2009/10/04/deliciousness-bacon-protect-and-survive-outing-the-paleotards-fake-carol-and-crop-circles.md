It's been almost [two weeks since one of these posts](https://bit.ly/1tHbR "https://bit.ly/1tHbR"); I've been pretty much conferenced out, with FOWA London taking up a sizeable chunk of last week and the AGI's GeoCommunity mopping up any spare time the week before that.

The hallmark of any successful tech conference is appallingly bad wifi which, despite the best protestations of the conference organisers, always buckles under the strain around 30 minutes into the opening keynote. All of which has meant that my Delicious account has been on a bit of a diet recently, but here's what did make it through the wifi ...* Yet more bacon products make it to market. Most of them are novelty value only but surely there's scope for [bacon flavoured mayo](https://bit.ly/vTHsX "https://bit.ly/vTHsX"), for those moments when the perfect BLT is just out of reach?
* Twickenham Fire Station tested its' air raid siren last week and m[emories of the Protect and Survive public service announcements](https://bit.ly/3st9ng "https://bit.ly/3st9ng") on British TV at the height of the Cold War came flooding back.
* My talk's at the AGI GeoCommunity conference seemed to get people talking; both [seriously](https://bit.ly/113ZU2 "https://bit.ly/113ZU2") and somewhat [tongue in cheek](https://bit.ly/111Vaz "https://bit.ly/111Vaz") and I also managed to [out the (neogeographer) Geoweb chair](https://bit.ly/OBkDL "https://bit.ly/OBkDL") as an old school paleogeographer.
* The CEO of the company I work for finally managed to achieve the accolade of being [faked](https://bit.ly/4o1pw "https://bit.ly/4o1pw") on Twitter.
* And the source of all the crop circles was finally found in a town in the US with a s[trangely familiar name](https://bit.ly/3UeNjr "https://bit.ly/3UeNjr").
