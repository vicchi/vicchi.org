Yet again it's been a while. But there's stuff out there on the Internet you know.
* Considering he was a fictitious character set in 1880's London, Arthur Conan Doyle certainly made sure that [Sherlock Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes") got about; someone's even displayed all of this on a [map of London](https://londonist.com/2009/11/the_london_of_sherlock_holmesmapped.php "https://londonist.com/2009/11/the_london_of_sherlock_holmesmapped.php").
* Want an instant ergonomic desk? Let me rephrase that. Want an instant ergonomic desk that clips to your car's steering wheel? What more could you need? "[This has been a total lifesaver. It allows me to prop my sheet music against the wheel, allowing me to play the guitar with both hands while driving](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000IZGIA8 "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000IZGIA8")."
* Recently [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/ "https://www.dropbox.com/") stopped synching my files from my local DropBox to my remote one in the cloud. [Deleting ~/.dropbox](https://rubenlaguna.com/wp/2008/10/20/dropbox-not-syncing-files/ "https://rubenlaguna.com/wp/2008/10/20/dropbox-not-syncing-files/") helped get things synching properly again.
* I can never remember the key combinations needed to start my Intel Macs into single user mode, or to boot from the DVD. The Apple KnowledgeBase [has it all documented](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT1533 "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT1533").
* The [GeoVation Challenge](https://challenge.geovation.org.uk/ "https://challenge.geovation.org.uk/") made into [the BBC](https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8330346.stm "https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8330346.stm"). Disclosure; I'm on the judging panel.
* Want to travel from Newquay in Cornwall to Kyle of Lochalsh in Scotland? Want to do it by train? You better have a grand to spare; [£1002.00 to be precise](https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/03/first-1000-pound-train-fare "https://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/03/first-1000-pound-train-fare").
* In Schipol and seeing a crocodile in a suitcase? [This may help explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM4vjv3F06s "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM4vjv3F06s").
* Best. Magazine. Name. Ever. [Part 2](https://www.totalcarpmagazine.com/Home/ "https://www.totalcarpmagazine.com/Home/").
* I never made it to the Social Media '09 conference in London this year; but I was [there in Tweet](https://www.flickr.com/photos/paul_clarke/4098714890/ "https://www.flickr.com/photos/paul_clarke/4098714890/") if not in body.
