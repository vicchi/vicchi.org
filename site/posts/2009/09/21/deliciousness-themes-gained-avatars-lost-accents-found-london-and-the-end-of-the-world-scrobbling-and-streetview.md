Look at all of this stuff that fell down the back of the internet and got lodged in my [Delicious bookmarks](http://www.delicious.com/vicchi "http://www.delicious.com/vicchi") ...* Posterous [recently gained themes](http://bit.ly/qZUXn "http://bit.ly/qZUXn") and Twitter [lost the background and avatar](http://bit.ly/PuVaS "http://bit.ly/PuVaS") settings for lots of accounts, mine included.
* Need to write München, Côte or Café with proper accents while on a Mac? [Easy when you know how](http://bit.ly/xPa84 "http://bit.ly/xPa84").
* If you live in London, apparently you're either [very rich or a loser](http://bit.ly/FknBX "http://bit.ly/FknBX"). It also [rained](http://bit.ly/1w5hIq "http://bit.ly/1w5hIq") a lot and the [world ended](http://bit.ly/3nOrhD "http://bit.ly/3nOrhD"), at least in Old Street.
* [Spotify can scrobble to Last.fm](http://bit.ly/xaVOh "http://bit.ly/xaVOh") ... why did I not know this?
* Want to know how Google Streetview is put together? Google Japan have a [explanation](http://bit.ly/TF2t2 "http://bit.ly/TF2t2").
* I reached an [inspiration dead-end](http://bit.ly/Z7Hx6 "http://bit.ly/Z7Hx6") while preparing for this week's AGI conference; turns out [I'm not alone](http://bit.ly/Euvsi "http://bit.ly/Euvsi").
