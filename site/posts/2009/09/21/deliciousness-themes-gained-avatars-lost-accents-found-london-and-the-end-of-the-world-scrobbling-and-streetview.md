Look at all of this stuff that fell down the back of the internet and got lodged in my [Delicious bookmarks](https://www.delicious.com/vicchi "https://www.delicious.com/vicchi") ...

* Posterous [recently gained themes](https://bit.ly/qZUXn "https://bit.ly/qZUXn") and Twitter [lost the background and avatar](https://bit.ly/PuVaS "https://bit.ly/PuVaS") settings for lots of accounts, mine included.
* Need to write München, Côte or Café with proper accents while on a Mac? [Easy when you know how](https://bit.ly/xPa84 "https://bit.ly/xPa84").
* If you live in London, apparently you're either [very rich or a loser](https://bit.ly/FknBX "https://bit.ly/FknBX"). It also [rained](https://bit.ly/1w5hIq "https://bit.ly/1w5hIq") a lot and the [world ended](https://bit.ly/3nOrhD "https://bit.ly/3nOrhD"), at least in Old Street.

* Want to know how Google Streetview is put together? Google Japan have a [explanation](https://bit.ly/TF2t2 "https://bit.ly/TF2t2").
* I reached an [inspiration dead-end](https://bit.ly/Z7Hx6 "https://bit.ly/Z7Hx6") while preparing for this week's AGI conference; turns out [I'm not alone](https://bit.ly/Euvsi "https://bit.ly/Euvsi").
