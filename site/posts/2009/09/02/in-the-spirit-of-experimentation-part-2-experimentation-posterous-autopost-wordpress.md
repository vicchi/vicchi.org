Posterous continues to impress and is fast becoming the main source of blog posts, both on my [Posterous blog](https://vicchi.posterous.com/ "https://vicchi.posterous.com/") and autoposted onto my [main blog](/ "/").


We're all good Web 2.0 citizens these days and that means we tag everything; the [Posterous FAQ](https://posterous.com/faq "https://posterous.com/faq") has this to say on the subject of tags:
"Add tags simply in the subject of your email using the syntax ((tag: apple, gadgets)). You can see your tags on the homepage of your site and click on them to see those posts."



So, in the continued spirit of experimentation, this post is tagged with "*experimentation*", "*posterous*", "*autopost*" and "*wordpress*" via the subject line "*In the Spirit of Experimentation, Part 2 ((tag: experimentation, posterous, autopost, wordpress))*"; let's see how this gets reflected in the post and in the autoposted WordPress version.
