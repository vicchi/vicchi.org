Is it lying in your shed or garage, unloved, a bit rusty and in need of some care and attention? You'd love to get it going again but lost the original maintenance manual?

Maybe this Haynes manual, spotted this morning in Foyles on London's Charing Cross Road, is what you need.

It even covers the Saturn V you have lying around under the bed; you know, the big rocket bit that goes under the lander. Go on, there's really no excuse now.
