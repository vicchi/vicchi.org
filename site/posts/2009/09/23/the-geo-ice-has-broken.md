Last night was the icebreaker for the [AGI GeoCommunity](https://www.agi.org.uk/bfora/systems/xmlviewer/default.asp?arg=DS_AGI_ABOUTART_73/_page.xsl/94 "https://www.agi.org.uk/bfora/systems/xmlviewer/default.asp?arg=DS_AGI_ABOUTART_73/_page.xsl/94") conference in Stratford-upon-Avon (but not Stratford-upon-Avon, oh no, that's the district not the town you know) and the run up to the conference has started extremely well, with the added bonus for me that [John McKerrell](https://twitter.com/mcknut "https://twitter.com/mcknut") of [mapme.at](https://mapme.at/ "https://mapme.at/") used a quote from one of my decks as the [#geocom landing page](https://mapme.at/geocom "https://mapme.at/geocom").[![](https://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/vicchi/ise33VxTrEspfnFnVK7j3TnN9aDxCEs5NtsBh9c7ngekUsGezItLh4keYWcZ/mapme.at.jpg.scaled.500.jpg)](https://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/vicchi/kWSsGINcZkantJksNzxaynjrAf7jUscs4iR0Ajf8uzdGbtIuu4DLloBV8BZk/mapme.at.jpg "https://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/vicchi/kWSsGINcZkantJksNzxaynjrAf7jUscs4iR0Ajf8uzdGbtIuu4DLloBV8BZk/mapme.at.jpg") Twitter is abuzz with commentary on what's happening and who's going to be doing what, all accompanied by the eponymous [#geocom](https://search.twitter.com/search?q=%2523geocom "https://search.twitter.com/search?q=%2523geocom") hashtag and everyone's hoping that the conference lives up to their expectations. As [Thierry Gregorious](https://twitter.com/Thierry_G "https://twitter.com/Thierry_G") aptly put it on Twitter "[*#geocom If this feed is producing messages at current rate, will people be glued to their mobiles instead of the presentations?*](https://twitter.com/Thierry_G/statuses/4170205359 "https://twitter.com/Thierry_G/statuses/4170205359")" ... we shall see.The ice breaker dinner well and truly broke ice and I landed up on a table full of geostrangers and [Andrew Turner](https://twitter.com/ajturner "https://twitter.com/ajturner"); as table 24 we put in a rather respectable joint second place in the 100 question quiz, but then crashed and burned to 3rd place after not being nearly accurate enough in the tie-breaker question on when precisely did the Berlin Wall come down.After a surprisingly good dinner, with surprisingly good wine we sat through a surprising, and *intriguing*, comedienne who appeared to be the result of a union between Jasper Carrot and Victoria Wood. It was certainly an experience.Finally everyone headed to the bar where some overworked and entirely good natured bar staff served us *geolibations*, *geolagulavins* and *geo-gin-and-tonics* until the early hours.And the conference hasn't even begun yet ...[![](https://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/vicchi/AHSEfGOUziTmbTZB9NmzNenRCjz6ZeW6MdW1abf7y7lYnC2DJxs30AndFVpd/IMG_2010.jpg.scaled.500.jpg)](https://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/vicchi/r1Zd6x4vauXvhqxuSil5XryVoiXYBGWsoL99Sjeucq8FVwMR1c47CIVqmexu/IMG_2010.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg "https://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/vicchi/r1Zd6x4vauXvhqxuSil5XryVoiXYBGWsoL99Sjeucq8FVwMR1c47CIVqmexu/IMG_2010.jpg.scaled.1000.jpg")    [Posted via email](https://posterous.com "https://posterous.com") from [Gary's Posterous](https://vicchi.posterous.com/the-geo-ice-has-broken "https://vicchi.posterous.com/the-geo-ice-has-broken")
