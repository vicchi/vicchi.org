This week's trawl through my Delicous bookmarks. Actually this is last week's trawl but real life got in the way of posting and I beg your indulgence.

* Last week, Snow Leopard, AKA Mac OS X 10.6 was released though some places seem to now be selling an even more advanced version, [Mac OS X 15.6](http://bit.ly/2CPL9u "http://bit.ly/2CPL9u").
* I like chilli sauce, I have a fine and wide range of the stuff in the larder at home; but some people must really really like the stuff to [buy it a gallon at a time](http://bit.ly/4l0Mk1 "http://bit.ly/4l0Mk1").
* In my day job I do geo stuff but I wasn't aware that a globe, an inflatable one come to that, has [sharp corners and isn't suitable for children](http://bit.ly/RYaac "http://bit.ly/RYaac").
* While we're on the subject of geo, Virgin Media found out the hard way that place names aren't unique and sometimes there's more than one place sharing a name; [Whitchurch](http://bit.ly/hRXmc "http://bit.ly/hRXmc") in this particular case.
