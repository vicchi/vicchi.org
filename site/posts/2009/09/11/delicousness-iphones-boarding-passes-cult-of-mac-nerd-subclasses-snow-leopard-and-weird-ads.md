The end of the week, semi regular, hand selected, carefully edited snapshot of what made it into my [Delicious bookmarks](https://delicious.com/vicchi/ "https://delicious.com/vicchi/") this week.

* Last week I blogged about my [experiences with an electronic boarding pass](https://bit.ly/2XYNb9 "https://bit.ly/2XYNb9"), hosted on my iPhone, while travelling home from Amsterdam's Schipol airport. Cult of Mac came across it, liked it, and used it as a [basis for an article](https://bit.ly/kTnar "https://bit.ly/kTnar"). Which was nice.
* Remember those Venn Diagrams you did in maths class? Now you can use one to work out which of the [subclasses of nerddom](https://bit.ly/3BRLy "https://bit.ly/3BRLy") you belong to. Naturally I place myself in the *geek with a life* subclass, which is strangely absent from the diagram.
* At the weekend I upgraded my work MacBook Pro to Snow Leopard, Apple's latest version of the OS X operating system. And then 4 days later I [downgraded it back to Leopard](https://bit.ly/2ArYK "https://bit.ly/2ArYK").
* Want to buy used toilet paper, a used tombstone or a rottweiler called Mr Giggles? [Some people think you do](https://bit.ly/3klUgS "https://bit.ly/3klUgS").
