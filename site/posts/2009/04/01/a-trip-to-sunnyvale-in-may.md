I'm taking [a trip to Sunnyvale](http://dplr.it/guest/c2c36d6377e7770c7aa9 "http://dplr.it/guest/c2c36d6377e7770c7aa9") between May 17th and May 30th to attend [Where 2.0](http://en.oreilly.com/where2009/ "http://en.oreilly.com/where2009/") in San Jose and catch up with all my colleagues at the Yahoo! mothership on First Avenue.
