I'm taking [a trip to Sunnyvale](https://dplr.it/guest/c2c36d6377e7770c7aa9 "https://dplr.it/guest/c2c36d6377e7770c7aa9") between May 17th and May 30th to attend [Where 2.0](https://en.oreilly.com/where2009/ "https://en.oreilly.com/where2009/") in San Jose and catch up with all my colleagues at the Yahoo! mothership on First Avenue.
