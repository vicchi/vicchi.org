A couple of weeks ago I wrote an article on this blog that highlighted the issues around managing our digital identity.

"[*Managing our digital identity through those sources we know about is a challenge for a significant percentage of the online population*](/2009/08/10/harvesting-your-digital-dandruff-crumbs-and-footprints-for-fun-and-profit/ "/2009/08/10/harvesting-your-digital-dandruff-crumbs-and-footprints-for-fun-and-profit/")"

Then this morning, (ex Yahoo!) [Cathy Ma](http://twitter.com/cathyma "http://twitter.com/cathyma") posted a link to her [recent blog post](http://cathyma.com/2009/08/307/trackback/ "http://cathyma.com/2009/08/307/trackback/") about the [Personas project](http://personas.media.mit.edu/ "http://personas.media.mit.edu/") being run by Aaron Zinman at MIT. Personas tries to "show you how the internet sees you". So I duly surfed over to [http://personas.media.mit.edu/](http://personas.media.mit.edu/ "http://personas.media.mit.edu/") and plugged in my full name and some time later a rather slick Flash animation gave me this supposed "characterization of the person".

<!-- TEASER_END -->

Anything but the most cursory of glances quickly showed that something was wrong. If this is how the internet sees me, where does sports, fashion and medicine come from? So I tried again, this time under my usual net nickname, vicchi. Some more chugging and analysing later and I had a second characterization of the online me.

[![vicchi Persona](/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vicchi-Persona-300x94.jpg "vicchi Persona")](/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vicchi-Persona.jpg "/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vicchi-Persona.jpg")

It's different but it's still not right, sports are still there but now they've been joined by military, aggression and illegal. So I reran both characterizations and this time looked at what was going on and I went through the full spectrum from WTF to OMG.

Sadly, this relegates the Personas project to merely an intriguing but ultimately flawed experiment, because unless you have a really unique name, online there's going to be more than one of you.
