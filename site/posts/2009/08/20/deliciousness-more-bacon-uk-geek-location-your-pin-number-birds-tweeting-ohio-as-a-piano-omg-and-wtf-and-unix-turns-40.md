A semi regular, almost weekly, trawl through the latest stuff on the interwebs bookmarked onÂ [Delicious](http://www.delicious.com/vicchi "http://www.delicious.com/vicchi").


* This fad for all things bacon flavoured is getting out of hand; a few weeks back it was [bacon flavoured vodka](http://bit.ly/ScbFC "http://bit.ly/ScbFC") and now you can get [bacon flavoured lip balm](http://bit.ly/5EdqT "http://bit.ly/5EdqT").
* There's lots of geeks in the United Kingdom; now you can [know where they are](http://bit.ly/mQ8VZ "http://bit.ly/mQ8VZ"). I might [be there as well](/pages/speaking/ "/pages/speaking/").
* Someone posted the [PIN number from your credit or debit card](http://bit.ly/nQrh9 "http://bit.ly/nQrh9") onto the interwebs.
* Twitter's popular these days; even the [birds in the trees](http://bit.ly/t4MsB "http://bit.ly/t4MsB") are RT'ing.
* If Ohio was a piano, ever [wondered how it'd sound](http://bit.ly/nUbA6 "http://bit.ly/nUbA6")? Possibly the weirdest geo and mapping visualization. Ever.
* There's a spectrum from [OMG to WTF](http://bit.ly/4M2Oh "http://bit.ly/4M2Oh"), pasing through"I get it", "that's strange" and "I don't get it" along the way.
* And finally, [UNIX turned 40](http://bit.ly/rhMQl "http://bit.ly/rhMQl"). It's still younger than me though.
