This week's selection of what I bookmarked on [Delicious](http://www.delicious.com/vicchi "http://www.delicious.com/vicchi").


* Illustrating just how broken the mobile operator's customer support is, [Rummb](http://www.rummble.com/rummble.do "http://www.rummble.com/rummble.do")[le's CEO Andrew Scott](http://twitter.com/andrewjscott/ "http://twitter.com/andrewjscott/") details his [9 month battle with O2](http://www.mobileindustryreview.com/2009/08/guest_post_andrew_from_rummble_on_the_curious_case_of_john_nordstrm.html "http://www.mobileindustryreview.com/2009/08/guest_post_andrew_from_rummble_on_the_curious_case_of_john_nordstrm.html") after they refused to honour an agreed deal and [MoanLog's](http://www.moanlog.com/ "http://www.moanlog.com/") [Gaurav Patel](http://twitter.com/gauravity/ "http://twitter.com/gauravity/") details the [extraordinary length that 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDyZkwqQYY&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Etheregister%2Eco%2Euk%2F2009%2F08%2F04%2Fnumber%5Fportability%2F&feature=player_embedded "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDyZkwqQYY&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Etheregister%2Eco%2Euk%2F2009%2F08%2F04%2Fnumber%5Fportability%2F&feature=player_embedded") went to so they didn't have to give out a PAC code to a customer.
* [Twitter was brought down](http://status.twitter.com/post/157191978/ongoing-denial-of-service-attack "http://status.twitter.com/post/157191978/ongoing-denial-of-service-attack") by a distributed denial of service attack; but some [people survived](http://www.flickr.com/photos/colm/3795446612 "http://www.flickr.com/photos/colm/3795446612") thanks to a PostIt note.
* Chiswick Business Park knows how to speak to [humans and to dogs](http://www.mobypicture.com/user/andrewgrill/view/409039 "http://www.mobypicture.com/user/andrewgrill/view/409039").
* The world didn't end at [12:34:56 on 07/08/09](http://twitpic.com/d5hp9 "http://twitpic.com/d5hp9"); probably because it had already happened in July to the US.
* The Londoner and the geo geek in me took a trip down memory lane with a collection of [London Underground Tube maps](http://www.verydodgy.com/tube/ "http://www.verydodgy.com/tube/").
* And finally, thanks to [MobilePress](http://mobilepress.co.za/ "http://mobilepress.co.za/"), vicchi.org went mobile.
