Posterous is a service that just begs for experimentation; not only because it's a beautifully simplistic yet rich service but also because the Help and FAQ pages can be a little bit light on detail for some of the less obvious questions; probably to avoid scaring those of a less-power-user-frame-of-mind away.

So the Posterous FAQ at https://posterous.com/faq says this "We'll do smarter things for photos, MP3's, documents and video (both links AND files)".

Link eh? In the spirit of experimentation let's try this, firstly from the easy and obvious one ... twitpic.com

... and rival yfrog.com ...

... and from my Flickr photostream ...

... and finally a more challenging one, from my Facebook photo album ...

... there's only one way to find out, so let's send this to Posterous right now and see what happens; all in the spirit of experimentation naturally.
