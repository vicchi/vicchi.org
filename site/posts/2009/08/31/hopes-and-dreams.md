The one at the back is a replica shirt from the always-the-underdog- even-when-they-get-to-the-Superbowl. The one at the front is from the, defunct since 1998, World League of American Football and NFL Europe team the London Monarchs.   
   
The former reached the Superbowl four times but have never managed to quite get there. I still live in hope.   
   
The latter won World Ball 1 in 1991 at the old Wembley Stadium. I was there and it was an amazing season with only 1 loss during the entire regular season.   
   
What a lot of hopes and dreams invested in two pieces of clothing.
