This week's trawl through what appeared on the interwebs and made it into my Delicious bookmarks.* The march towards all things bacon flavoured continues unabated; now you can get [bacon (and mint) flavoured, err, mints](http://bit.ly/xLdyn "http://bit.ly/xLdyn") and that get-you-going-in-the-morning first cup of [coffee can now be bacon flavoured](http://bit.ly/r2CQi "http://bit.ly/r2CQi") as well. Where's this going to end?
* Mac OS X 10.6, AKA Snow Leopard, got officially released today. Some people [rushed out, bought it and installed it](http://bit.ly/2g5y3b "http://bit.ly/2g5y3b"). But as ever, there's [some compatibility problems](http://bit.ly/vazOU "http://bit.ly/vazOU"), not the least of which (for me at least) is that the Cisco VPN client may (or may not) work properly. It's also for Intel based Macs only so a lot of [PowerPC based Mac owners are going to be sad](http://bit.ly/Z75B0 "http://bit.ly/Z75B0").
* First reviews of the new [Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy](http://bit.ly/8f2Bh "http://bit.ly/8f2Bh") book, not written by Douglas Adams on account of him being dead, find it "*not really funny*" and "l*ess a case of So Long And Thanks For All The Fish and more a case of So Long And Thanks For All The Money*".
* #wherecamp, the geogeeks (un)conference of choice, is coming to Europe in the form of the aptly named [#WhereCampEU](http://bit.ly/Dg485 "http://bit.ly/Dg485"). Naturally, I'll be there.
* While walking into Soho, I found one of [London's lost streets right under my feet](http://bit.ly/ylWzQ "http://bit.ly/ylWzQ"). Literally.
* And finally, real men don't rock their child to sleep, they [write a shell script](http://bit.ly/1dh4hk "http://bit.ly/1dh4hk") to do it for them.
