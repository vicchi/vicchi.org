I finished up part 2 of my 2009 review with the observation that 2009 [seemed to be a lot less about technology and more about communities and people](/2009/12/24/2009-in-review-part-2-organisations/ "/2009/12/24/2009-in-review-part-2-organisations/") so what better way to end my 2009 review by calling attention to the people who I feel deserve mention.

You know who you all are. You put up with me, with geo and with my work and online life and you never stop believing.

2009 was a good year for people and for geo; I look forward to writing 2010's review of the year and see that we've gone to the great heights that [The Guardian and Garner expect of the location aware Internet](https://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2009/dec/11/you-decide-future-technology "https://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2009/dec/11/you-decide-future-technology").That's it; I'm all blogged out for 2009 and so I wish a very Happy Christmas and a geo-tastic New Year to you all.
