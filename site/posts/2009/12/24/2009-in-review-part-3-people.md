I finished up part 2 of my 2009 review with the observation that 2009 [seemed to be a lot less about technology and more about communities and people](/2009/12/24/2009-in-review-part-2-organisations/ "/2009/12/24/2009-in-review-part-2-organisations/") so what better way to end my 2009 review by calling attention to the people who I feel deserve mention.

You know who you all are. You put up with me, with geo and with my work and online life and you never stop believing. I don't need to say anymore[![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2521/3994103457_fe33abfb97.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/vicchi/3994103457/ "http://www.flickr.com/photos/vicchi/3994103457/")Then there's the other people who've believed, a word I've used a lot in this set of linked 2009 review posts, who've helped, supported, encouraged, criticised and who've given me a platform to speak on.* [Tyler Bell](http://twitter.com/twbell "http://twitter.com/twbell") - ex head of Geo product for Yahoo! and now at [alikelist.com](http://www.alikelist.com/home "http://www.alikelist.com/home")

2009 was a good year for people and for geo; I look forward to writing 2010's review of the year and see that we've gone to the great heights that [The Guardian and Garner expect of the location aware Internet](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2009/dec/11/you-decide-future-technology "http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2009/dec/11/you-decide-future-technology").That's it; I'm all blogged out for 2009 and so I wish a very Happy Christmas and a geo-tastic New Year to you all.
