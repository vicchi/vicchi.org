Twitter can expand your horizons or just make wasting time a pleasure; here's a good example thanks to [@SianySianySiany](https://twitter.com/SianySianySiany "https://twitter.com/SianySianySiany") - the [Album Cover](https://www.sianyland.com/%24blog/2009/02/26/my_album_cover "https://www.sianyland.com/%24blog/2009/02/26/my_album_cover") meme.


[![Album Cover Art?](/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/questionable.jpg "Album Cover Art?")](/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/questionable.jpg "/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/questionable.jpg")



It's devastingly simple. Here's how it works:

First you need a name for your band or group. Fire up Wikipedia, click on "Random article" or on this link: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random"). The title of the random article is your band name.

Next you'll need a name for your band's breakthrough album. Go to QuotationsPage.com, click on "Random Quotes" or on this link: [https://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3](https://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3 "https://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3"). The last four or five words of the last quote on the page are your album's title.

Two down, one to go; you need some album art. Go to Flickr, click on "Explore" and then on "Last 7 Days Interesting" or on this link: [https://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/](https://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/ "https://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/"). The third picture is your album artwork.

Now use a graphics package to put them all together. If you're a Flickr member you can use Picnik or you can use something like Photoshop or if you're on a Mac you can use Pixelmator.

And here, in all its glory is the album cover for the groundbreaking and seminal Would Have Confused Einstein by Securities Industry Automation Corporation. I don't know about you but it looks vaguely Kraftwerk-ian, Vangelis-ish or Tangerine Dream-y to me.
