In 2014 I made some GeoHipster [predictions](/2014/01/04/gazing-into-the-geo-crystal-ball-for-2014/ "/2014/01/04/gazing-into-the-geo-crystal-ball-for-2014/") for the then coming year for the geo industry. As far as crystal ball gazing is concerned I didn't think [I did too badly](/2015/01/23/how-did-2014s-geo-predictions-actually-work-out/ "/2015/01/23/how-did-2014s-geo-predictions-actually-work-out/"), though some people disagreed. This year GeoHipster has done it again and I've made some more predictions. The [whole list of predictions is online](http://geohipster.com/2014/12/27/will-hot-geo-2015-predictions-geohipster-crowd/ "http://geohipster.com/2014/12/27/will-hot-geo-2015-predictions-geohipster-crowd/") and it's well worth reading.

This is what the crystal globe divulged once I'd dusted it off.

More Geospatial Visualisations, Maybe Less Maps
-----------------------------------------------



One of the great things about having a wife who understands and accepts that you're a map nerd is getting great Christmas gifts such as [London: The Information Capital](http://www.amazon.co.uk/LONDON-Information-Capital-graphics-change/dp/1846148472 "http://www.amazon.co.uk/LONDON-Information-Capital-graphics-change/dp/1846148472") by James Cheshire and Oliver Uberti. The book is subtitled 100 maps and graphics that will change how you view the city. Reading this book made me realise that there were as many maps as there were visualisations with spatial data and that I also realised that this book wasn't an isolated instance. More and more geospatial information is being visualised, both online and elsewhere. This means lots of maps but not just maps. This is a trend that will continue into 2015 and beyond as people who aren't used to maps still want to visualise mapping data.

More Tangible Maps
------------------



At home I've got gift wrap with maps on it, a notebook covered in maps and even a map on the case of my phone. Walking through our local bookstore at the weekend, I was struck by just how many maps there were in so many shapes, sizes and forms and with not a single digital map to be seen. Maybe the public has fallen back in love with tangible maps as digital maps become more and more part of our daily lives? Take a brief [search through Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/search?q=map "https://www.etsy.com/uk/search?q=map") and you can get a map on all you ever wanted and a lot more besides. Maybe the public has fallen back in love with tangible maps as digital maps become more and more part of our daily lives? Whatever the reason, maps are here to stay.

More Bad Maps
-------------



Both of the previous two predictions means we're going to continue seeing a lot more maps. But that also widens the scope for a lot more bad maps. There's even a Twitter hashtag for this. Take a search for [#badmaps](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23badmaps&src=typd "https://twitter.com/search?q=%23badmaps&src=typd") if you want your eyes to bleed and whatever cartographic skill you possess to shriek out in anguish. This is not going to get any better. Now, because anymore can make a map means anyone will make a map, regardless of whether they should or not.

More Doing GIS, Without Knowing You're Doing GIS
------------------------------------------------



Coupled with the news of the forthcoming demise of Google Maps Engine and existing customers looking to take their web-based geographic visualisations onto another platform or toolset, more people will end up doing GIS, or at least the lower end of the GIS spectrum, blissfully unaware of the fact that what they’re doing is in any way connected with something called GIS. Expect ESRI to make ArcGIS online much less GIS-like and Mapbox’s [Turf](http://turfjs.org/ "http://turfjs.org/") and CartoDB to pick up lots of Google Maps emigres. Meanwhile people who are used to Javascript and web maps will look at toolkits like [Polymaps](http://polymaps.org/ "http://polymaps.org/") or [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/ "http://leafletjs.com/") and end up accidentally doing GIS, and free GIS tools such as QGIS will also reap the benefits of GME power users.

OSM Will Explode
----------------



It's a sweeping generalisation and probably a controversial one too, but OpenStreetMap seems to be divided into 4 tribes. Firstly there's the utopian tribe, truly believe that OSM is the only way forward for mapping data, that it will dominate across all forms of mapping data and that if only everyone else would embrace the ODbL and its' sharealike clause everything would be so much easier. Then there's the community tribe, who use and contribute to OSM because they like the community aspect first and the mapping aspect second. Thirdly there's the map tribe who just want to get on with mapping the world. Finally there's the pragmatic tribe who want to see OSM flourish in the current business world and realise that something probably has to change in order for that to happen.

Each tribe wants something different from OSM and although there's overlaps and blurring the lines, the OSM community is a divided one. I have to ask if this is sustainable in its' current form.

All of which means that 2015 might be the year OSM explodes. Sadly this doesn't mean uptake and contributions will explode, but my fearful prediction is that OSM itself will explode and fragment, with the possibility of OSM forking looming on the horizon.
