As the post COVID brain fog slowly clear and I get around to doing stuff I really meant to do but either couldn't summon up the energy to or just plain forgot about; it's time to tackle the growing
list of issues and pull requests on the Vaguely Rude Places Map [GitHub repo](https://github.com/vicchi/vaguely-rude-places).
