I don't grow my own organic vertices. Nor do I use gluten-free technology. At least not that I'm aware. But I have been known to geocode by hand, in small batches and I do follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/geohipster" target="_blank">@geohipster</a> Twitter account. According to a new map put together by <a href="https://www.ralphstraumann.ch/projects/geohipster-map/" target="_blank">Ralph Straumann</a>, that's enough to make me a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23geohipster&src=typd" target="_blank">#geohipster</a>.

Who am I to *argue* with a map?

It's a simple and neat affair. All followers of the @geohipster Twitter account with a location in their profile have that location geocoded and then shown on a map.

Of course, not everyone has a location that can be successfully geocoded. Either that or a lot of people really do live on [Null Island](https://www.nullisland.com/ "https://www.nullisland.com/"). These seems to be the only way to explain the cluster of people allegedly located somewhere off of the coast of North West Africa, South of Ghana and West of Equatorial Guinea, which just so happens to coincide with where you'll find latitude 0 and longitude 0.

Thankfully, whatever geocoder Ralph is using works properly and places me in the Teddington that's a suburb of South West London and not the Teddington that's near Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire.

Which makes me happy and also seems to makes me a Geo-hipster. Nothing in the vaguely defined and nebulous industry that is the geo industry should surprise me anymore.
