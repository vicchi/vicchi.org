On the back cover of last weeks Guardian Guide magazine is an advert for the latest book by John Grisham. Now I don't have any particular axe to grind where Mr Grisham is concerned; he's not my favourite of authors nor is his legal thriller genre one which I read that much of.

My gripe here is with the advert itself which, to my mind, contains not one, but two oxymorons.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

Firstly, The Broker is, apparently, *the new bestseller*. According to my dictionary, a bestseller is *a product, such as a book, that is among those sold in the largest numbers*.

Secondly, The Broker is also *the classic new novel*. Time to refer to the dictionary again. Hmm, classic is *having lasting significance or worth; enduring*.

Either the agency which put this piece of advertising together is remarkably prescient or there are two unanswered questions here ...


* How can a first edition, brand new book be a bestseller, seeing as it is, by definition, *new*?
* Likewise, how can a brand new book which has only just been published be seen as a *classic*. In say, five to ten years time; maybe. But just after publishing? I'm not so sure.


So, just as black is hailed as being the *new* black, maybe classic is the new new?
