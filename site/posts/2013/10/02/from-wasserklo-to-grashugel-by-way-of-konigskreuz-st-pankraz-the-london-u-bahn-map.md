Yesterday I took the S-Bahn from my local train station in the suburbs of London. At the terminus at Wasserklo I took the Nördlich U-Bahn Linie to Königskreuz St. Pankraz, changing onto the Städtich Linie and finally alighted at Grashügel. No. Wait. That's not right.

What I actually did was take the South West Trains suburban line into London Waterloo, hopped on the Northern Line to King's Cross St. Pancras and then changed onto the Metropolitan Line and got off at Farringdon. What's going on here?

This is the London Underground map, but not as we know it. [Horst Prillinger](https://www.aardvark.at/ "https://www.aardvark.at/") has taken all the station names and translated them, sometimes literally, sometimes using the underlying etymology of the name. As Horst says in his [accompanying blog post](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/horst.prillinger/metro/m/londonundergroundmapgerman.html "https://homepage.univie.ac.at/horst.prillinger/metro/m/londonundergroundmapgerman.html"), back in 2004 when this first surfaced ...

I have only a cursory command of the German language but I was still able to find this clever *and* funny in equal measures.
