Despite having a lot of NSFW content, estimated at between 2% to 4% by the site's founder, Tumblr is also the microblogging site that some maps and cartography aficionados call home. The scope and range of these is simply staggering. But now there's a new, albeit tenuously, related maps Tumblr in town.

For general maps enthusiasm, there's [Fuck Yes Maps!](https://fuckyesmaps.tumblr.com/ "https://fuckyesmaps.tumblr.com/"), run by *a boy and two girls who blog about maps because they're awesome*. No disagreement from me on that point.

Slightly more cartographically centred but similarly named is [Fuck Yeah Cartography](https://fuckyeahcartography.tumblr.com/ "https://fuckyeahcartography.tumblr.com/")! that *sets out to explore interesting representations of space*. Apparently. There's also [Fuck Yeah Maps](https://fuckyeahmaps.tumblr.com/ "https://fuckyeahmaps.tumblr.com/"), not to be confused with the Yes variant mentioned earlier.

If maps and globals are more your thing, the aptly named [Maps and Globes](https://maps-and-globes.tumblr.com/ "https://maps-and-globes.tumblr.com/") might appeal, which is curated by Emily who's *addicted to planar surfaces*.

Tumblr also seems to be populated by blogs about *people* ... doing ... *stuff*. Think [Stormtroopers Doing Things](https://stormtroopersdoingthingss.tumblr.com/ "https://stormtroopersdoingthingss.tumblr.com/") if you will. So it's probably a logical extension to this that there's now [Men Pointing At Maps](https://menpointingatmaps.tumblr.com/ "https://menpointingatmaps.tumblr.com/"). No, really.

All of which is good for showing just how many carto-nerds and map-geeks there are out there on today's Interwebs. But it does beg a question. Where are the women pointing at maps? Surely maps and pointing aren't a purely patriachal occupation. Someone should start a rival about women pointing at maps. Someone probably will ...
