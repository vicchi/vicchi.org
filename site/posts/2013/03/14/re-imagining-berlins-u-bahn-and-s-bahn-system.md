This is another mass transit map, but this time it's not of the London Underground system, but the [U-Bahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_U-Bahn "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_U-Bahn") and [S-Bahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_S-Bahn "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_S-Bahn") system in Berlin. The name U-Bahn derives from *Untergrundbahn*, or underground railway whilst S-Bahn comes from *Stadtschnellbahn*, or fast city train.

As a general rule of thumb, the London Underground is, as the name suggests, underground in the centre of the city and surfaces as you move into the suburbs. The same can't be said of the U-Bahn and S-Bahn, which is underground and overground in pretty much equal measures over a lot of the network.

But this post is not about the official map of Berlin's transport, it's about this, unofficial, map of Berlin's underground and not so underground trains.

Not content with [reworking London's Underground network maps](/2013/02/01/re-imagining-the-london-tube-map-with-curves-and-circles/ "/2013/02/01/re-imagining-the-london-tube-map-with-curves-and-circles/"), [Maxwell Roberts](https://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~mjr/underground/tubemap.html "https://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~mjr/underground/tubemap.html") has turned his sights on Berlin's, producing not only a rework map which looks very similar to the official London map, but also one which is all curves, with not a straight line to be seen.

I hope that both Berlin's BVG and S-Bahn Berlin are aware of Maxwell's work. As a fairly regular traveller to Berlin, I use the U and S-Bahn a lot and whilst the official map is accurate, it's not the easiest of thing to use at times.
