If you live in a city for any period of time, you form a mental image of what quantifies certain areas or neighbourhoods. If someone mentions, say, <em>posh</em> London, I instantly think of the area around Mayfair and Knightsbridge. But you could put this personal and biased view on a map?

It turns out Yelp has done just that, producing a heat map of my home city of all the reviews that mention [*posh*](https://www.yelp.com/wordmap/london/posh "https://www.yelp.com/wordmap/london/posh"). It looks pretty much as I'd imagine.

The same applies for the term [*hipster*](https://www.yelp.com/wordmap/london/hipster "https://www.yelp.com/wordmap/london/hipster"). I'd immediately associate the area around Hoxton and Old Street (AKA Silicon Roundabout) with all things hipsterish. As it turns out, so do Yelp's reviewers.

All of which is oddly comforting. Maybe my mental map of a city isn't so personal and subjective after all.

A tip of the hat is due to [Chris Osborne](https://twitter.com/osbornec "https://twitter.com/osbornec") for pointing out these mapping gems.
