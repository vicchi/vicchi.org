excerpt: Finally Summer has arrived in London just in time to coincide with the annual population exodus known as the summer holidays. But wait. When you arrive at your holiday destination, how do you order a beer? If you're lucky, you'll remember some rudimentary French or Spanish from your school days. But what about other languages? Surely there's a map for this essential information?

Luckily and to paraphrase the mantra of there's an app for that, there's also a *map* for that. Whether it's beer, bier, cerveza, pivo, birra or Ã¸l, this handy guide to beer throughout Europe and its environs will help you get that first cold beer of the holiday into your hands.
