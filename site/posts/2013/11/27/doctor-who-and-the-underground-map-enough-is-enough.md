excerpt: Oh look. It's another reworking of Harry Beck's London Underground map. <a href="http://cartonerd.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/the-underground-map-of-insert-here.html" target="_blank">Ken Field probably won't like it</a>. This one is Doctor Who related. All the usual suspects are present. Each line representing one of the Doctors? Yes. Stations representing monsters and adversaries? Yes. Vague notions of interchanges between the lines? Oh yes.

Now I'll freely admit I've been more than guilty of writing about re-workings of this particular map, [at least 12 times](/tags/tube/ "/tags/tube/"). Doctor Who has been on, then off, then back on our TV screens for 50 years; longer than I've been around, but only by 2 years.

But I'll also freely admit that Ken has a valid point. The tube map rework has been done to death. This is not to denigrate the amount of work that's been put into such a map. Far from it. This is an obvious labour of love and many hours have been put in to make the map not only what it shows but how it shows it.

But it's time to move on. Time to choose another way of representing interesting data. Time to move away from yet another map based around either the Underground map or some other, mass transit, map.

Though I often break them, my New Year's Resolution for 2014 will be no more posts on variations of the London Underground map.
