excerpt: You're a fully fledged map geek and cartography nerd. Your house is plastered with maps. You even have your map room as a <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/the-map-room/4f8c1ed9e4b0183208461f69" target="_blank">place</a> on Foursquare. What could you possibly add to your household?

The answer, spotted by [Tim Waters](https://twitter.com/tim_waters/ "https://twitter.com/tim_waters/"), is naturally, map furniture.

Where better to sit in comfort with a glass of your favourite tipple and plot your next mapping endeavour?

Naturally, I want one.
