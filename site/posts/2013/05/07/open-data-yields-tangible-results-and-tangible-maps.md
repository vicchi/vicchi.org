In January of this year I made a hopeful prediction that <a href="/2013/01/01/2013-the-year-of-the-tangible-map-and-return-of-the-map-as-art/" target="_blank">2013 would be the year of the tangible map</a>. 

This hope was prompted by [the maps I saw](/2012/11/23/of-w3g-agi-and-other-geographical-acronyms/ "/2012/11/23/of-w3g-agi-and-other-geographical-acronyms/") at one of London's geomob meetups in November of 2012, where I saw and, importantly for a tangible map, touched Anna Butler's [London wall map](http://www.wellingtonstravel.com/wall-map-london/ "http://www.wellingtonstravel.com/wall-map-london/") and a prototype of David Overton's [SplashMap](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1521486951/splashmaps "http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1521486951/splashmaps").

The hopeful prediction was made as a result of literally getting my hands on one of Anna's London maps and it's a treasured possession, though still sadly needing a suitable frame before it can take pride of place on a wall at home.

But what of [SplashMaps](http://www.splashmaps.net/ "http://www.splashmaps.net/")? In November 2012 the project was on Kickstarter and I was one of the investors in this most tangible of maps. In December 2012 Splashmaps met their funding targets and went into production and today, through the letterbox came my own, tangible, foldable, scrunchable and almost indestructible SplashMap of my local neighbourhood.

Now all if this could be taken to be simply my crowing with delight over maps. But there's a deeper context to all of these tangible maps. Both the London Wall Map and SplashMaps have come about due to one single thing ... *open data*. The case has often been made, though equally as often misunderstood, that open data is an economic stimulus. As many people ask why should we give something away for free as ask for data to opened up to the public.

Both of these maps wouldn't have been financially possible without access to open data; the pre-open data era licensing costs and restrictions alone would have put paid to any startup opportunities an aspiring entrepreneur came up with. But in these maps, the proof of what open data can do has become very real, indeed very tangible.
