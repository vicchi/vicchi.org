Where you choose to live is always a trade off between the pros and the cons, the good and the bad. It probably comes as no surprise that if you're a resident of Iowa and you have the most organic pigs in the United States you will also have the highest amount of pig waste.

But who would have thought that the downside to having the most organic mushrooms is that your state has the most amount of dams in need of repair. Apparently, this is the case if you live in Pennsylvania.

And maybe the cause of the highest binge drinking rate that you'll find in Wisconsin is all those acres of organic corn that's grown in that state.

A lot of the statistics, from sources including the U.S. Geological Survey, NASA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, look like they're issued by the Department Of Stating The Obvious and makes me wonder how much the residents of each U.S. State agree with how it's seen that their home State excels or doesn't.
