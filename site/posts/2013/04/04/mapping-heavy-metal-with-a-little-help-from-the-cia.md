If there's an unwritten law of digital map making it is this: given a data set with a geographical element, someone, somewhere, will probably make a map out of it.

A prime example of this law is mining data from [Encyclopedia Metallum](http://www.metal-archives.com/browse/country "http://www.metal-archives.com/browse/country") detailing the Heavy Metal bands per country and mashing it up with population data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ "https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/") (yes, this really exists) to make a map of Heavy Metal bands, by country, per capita.

While I'm not the biggest fan of heavy rock, the [resulting map](http://www.gislounge.com/map-of-heavy-metal-bands-by-country-per-capita/ "http://www.gislounge.com/map-of-heavy-metal-bands-by-country-per-capita/") does, err, rock.

Credit is also due to my lovely wife who, knowing my penchant for all things map related, pointed this out to me in the first place.
