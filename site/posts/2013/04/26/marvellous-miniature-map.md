Some maps are works of art; this miniature marvel is no exception. You'd be forgiven for thinking it's deserved of a place hanging on someone's wall, but the truth is that this map is far more likely to end up in a rubbish bin.

That's because this marvellous miniature map lives on the cover of a box of matches and empty boxes of matches have a very short shelf life before they end up in the rubbish. Which is a crying shame as this beautiful map with Mount Fuji in the background, a house and what looks like a tram deserves a kinder fate than that.
