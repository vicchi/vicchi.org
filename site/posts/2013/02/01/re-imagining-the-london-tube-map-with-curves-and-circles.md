Another day, another map and another [#mapgasm](/tags/mapgasm/ "/tags/mapgasm/") post. Actually another 2 maps, both of which are by [Max Roberts](http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~mjr/underground/tubemap.html "http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~mjr/underground/tubemap.html") and both of which have appeared on Annie Mole's Going Underground blog.

Continuing my fascination with the map of the London Underground, which I may have posted about before, Max has been wondering what the Tube Map would look like if it was all [curved](http://london-underground.blogspot.co.uk/2007/06/curvy-tube-map.html "http://london-underground.blogspot.co.uk/2007/06/curvy-tube-map.html").

Or maybe, just maybe what it would be like if the Tube Map was [circular](http://london-underground.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/tube-map-in-circles.html "http://london-underground.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/tube-map-in-circles.html"), in the most literal of fashions.

I wonder what Harry Beck would think of these re-imaginings of his iconic map; I think he'd probably approve.
