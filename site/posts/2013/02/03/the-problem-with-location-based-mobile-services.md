There's a problem with today's crop of location based mobile services, commonly referred to as LBMS; those little apps which sit on our smartphones and allow us to geotag status updates or photos, find relevant local place information or check-in at a place.

The problem isn't one of [privacy or tracking](/2011/04/21/ios-location-tracking-gross-invasion-of-privacy-or-media-sensationalism/ "/2011/04/21/ios-location-tracking-gross-invasion-of-privacy-or-media-sensationalism/"). Nor is the problem one of an LBMS [dying and going away](/2012/03/12/check-in-get-acquired-check-out-farewell-gowalla/ "/2012/03/12/check-in-get-acquired-check-out-farewell-gowalla/"). The problem isn't whether I can get a good location fix or whether the [results I get are accurate](/2012/11/06/when-geolocation-doesnt-locate/ "/2012/11/06/when-geolocation-doesnt-locate/") or not. The problem isn't even of the value of the data we, the customer, put into a service and whether we [can get it back again](/2012/11/03/of-digital-stuff-and-making-your-personal-interweb-history/ "/2012/11/03/of-digital-stuff-and-making-your-personal-interweb-history/").

No, the problem is whether we can actually use the service from our smartphone at all.

It's 2013 and I live in the suburbs of the capital of the United Kingdom and this happens all the time. Not in the uncharted wilds of the UK. Not in obscure regions of the world. But in my local neighbourhood and in the heart of London. And it's not just a problem with Vodafone, my current cellular provider. Over the last few years I've been on T-Mobile, on Orange and on O2 and all the cellular carriers seem to have exactly the same problem; one which makes a mockery of their coverage maps. According to [Vodafone's map](https://www.vodafone.co.uk/our-network-and-coverage/uk-coverage-map/index.htm "https://www.vodafone.co.uk/our-network-and-coverage/uk-coverage-map/index.htm"), I should be getting high or at least variable 3G data coverage where I live, but instead I get variable or no coverage at all when walking in my local neighbourhoods.

3G data coverage that drops in and out; ***that's*** the problem with today's location based mobile services.

I'm getting off of my soapbox now ...
