Most maps are pointers to something; from today's turn-by-turn voice guided navigation to the "X marks the spot" treasure maps of legend.

This map however, is not a pointer *to* riches, instead it's made *of* riches.




> A large-scale, unique and intricate portrait of our Earth - a planet which is surely a jewel of the universe - innovatively created from 330,000 hand-cut pieces of stained glass, 1238 jewels totalling 260 carats, and over 6900 LEDs.

I've written before about [maps as art](/2012/11/01/the-maps-as-art-debate/ "/2012/11/01/the-maps-as-art-debate/"), but this is both a map, a work of art and the map as art and with a tip of the hat to [Sitaram Shastri](https://twitter.com/seetu/status/305558612166713345 "https://twitter.com/seetu/status/305558612166713345") for the heads up.
