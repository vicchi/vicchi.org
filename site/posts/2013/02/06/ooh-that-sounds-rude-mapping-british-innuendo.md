No-one can really define what being British is, though [many have tried](https://www.bbcamerica.com/mind-the-gap/2012/12/11/how-to-explain-britishness-to-an-american/ "https://www.bbcamerica.com/mind-the-gap/2012/12/11/how-to-explain-britishness-to-an-american/"). One thing that lots of people do seem to agree on is that part of being British is a love for and an appreciation of the [British sense of humour](https://planetivy.com/features/17242/the-planet-ivy-pocket-guide-to-the-british-sense-of-humour/ "https://planetivy.com/features/17242/the-planet-ivy-pocket-guide-to-the-british-sense-of-humour/"). This can be roughly and with a sweeping generalisation said to consist of equal parts of finding fun in everyday situations [Peep Show](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/peep-show "https://www.channel4.com/programmes/peep-show")), satire and parody ([Have I Got News For You](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mkw3 "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mkw3")), social awkwardness ([The Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(UK_TV_series) "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(UK_TV_series)")), surrealism and nonsense ([Monty Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python")) and innuendo (the [Carry On](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_On_(film_series) "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_On_(film_series)") films).

Focus on that trait of innuendo for a moment. Could you possibly combine the British fondness for innuendo with geography and put it on a map? It turns out you can. So I did. It may be vaguely NSFW but there's real geographical data behind this.

Maybe it's part of bring British, but an airport whose code is [BUM](https://www.world-airport-codes.com/united-states/butler-1139.html "https://www.world-airport-codes.com/united-states/butler-1139.html") is just ... funny.

As a classic Web 2.0 style maps mashup, this is never going to win any awards for originality or innovativeness. But the source of each of these vaguely rude sounding names was from Yahoo's WOE data set, before the data was released via the [GeoPlanet API](https://developer.yahoo.com/geo/geoplanet/ "https://developer.yahoo.com/geo/geoplanet/") and (currently offline) GeoPlanet Data download. A list of real but amusing sounding place names, culled from GeoPlanet by one of the old Yahoo! Geo team, has been sitting in a file on one of my backup drives for too many years now. But given a geographic data set. Stamen's wonderful [Toner](https://maps.stamen.com/toner/ "https://maps.stamen.com/toner/") map tiles and a JavaScript maps API, in this case [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/ "https://leafletjs.com/"), the temptation to make a map out of it all was just too strong.

Yes it's a map, yes it's geographical innuendo and yes, it's very much part of the British sense of humour. If you're British, try not to snigger too much; if you're not British, just shake your head sadly and mutter "those crazy Brits".
