If you think you know the map of the London Underground network think again. You probably think the Metropolitan Line runs between Amersham and Aldgate; but on this map it doesnt. Instead, it runs between *Ram Shame* and *Data Gel*. The southwest termini for the District Line are Richmond and Wimbledon. Maybe not. According to this map, *Inch Dorm* and *Bowel Mind* are the end of the line. It's good to know I used to live near *Foldaway Rhumba* rather than Fulham Broadway, that Nokia's central London office is just by *Apt Nodding* and I feel sorry for someone who lives near Lancaster Gate, sorry, I mean *Castrate Angel*.

It's amazing what you get when you make anagrams out of each and every station on the Tube network.
