Oh people of the interwebs; you are indeed a wondrous thing. If you build something and put it up on the internet, you've no expectation that anyone will see it, let alone look at it. But it appears that the combination of innuendo and some vaguely sounding rude place names (actually with some very rude place names) seems to be something that the citizens of the internet actually like.

The map hit the internet at [maps.geotastic.org/rude/](http://maps.geotastic.org/rude/ "http://maps.geotastic.org/rude/") around lunchtime on the 6th. of February; since then, several things have happened.

Firstly, Eric Rodenbeck, the CEO of Stamen Design, whose map tiles I used on the Rude Map, dropped me an email to say he liked it. I'm a massive fan of the cartography that Stamen produces and this would, alone, be enough to make the making of the map worthwhile.

But then, the URL of the site started proliferating over [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=maps.geotastic.org%2Frude&src=typd "https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=maps.geotastic.org%2Frude&src=typd") ... including [Jonathan Crowe](https://twitter.com/maproomblog/status/300612015477645313 "https://twitter.com/maproomblog/status/300612015477645313"), author of the late and utterly lamented [Map Room](http://www.maproomblog.com/ "http://www.maproomblog.com/") blog.

Then the map started to get written about. Firstly by [The Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/iv-drip/take-a-trip-to-innuendoland-with-this-interactive-map-of-the-worlds-rudest-place-names-8483442.html "http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/iv-drip/take-a-trip-to-innuendoland-with-this-interactive-map-of-the-worlds-rudest-place-names-8483442.html"), then by [Laughing Squid](http://laughingsquid.com/vaguely-rude-place-names-of-the-world/ "http://laughingsquid.com/vaguely-rude-place-names-of-the-world/"), [Blame It On The Voices](http://www.blameitonthevoices.com/2013/02/the-world-map-of-vaguely-rude-place.html "http://www.blameitonthevoices.com/2013/02/the-world-map-of-vaguely-rude-place.html"), [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/duplicates/186wxi/the_world_map_of_vaguely_rude_place_names/ "http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/duplicates/186wxi/the_world_map_of_vaguely_rude_place_names/") and [io9](http://io9.com/5983071/an-interactive-map-of-places-with-slightly-dirty-names "http://io9.com/5983071/an-interactive-map-of-places-with-slightly-dirty-names").

[![Rude Places Map - The Independent](/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Rude-Places-Map-The-Independent-1024x731.jpg)](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/iv-drip/take-a-trip-to-innuendoland-with-this-interactive-map-of-the-worlds-rudest-place-names-8483442.html "http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/iv-drip/take-a-trip-to-innuendoland-with-this-interactive-map-of-the-worlds-rudest-place-names-8483442.html")

And it keeps on getting mentions on Twitter, on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/s/maps.geotastic.org%2Frude "https://plus.google.com/s/maps.geotastic.org%2Frude") and other social networks. According to the server logs, the map's been viewed a staggering (to me at least) *53,000* times; this definitely classes as a first for me. So with tongue firmly in cheek and innuendo firmly in mind, it seems that if you build it, they will *come* can be the case sometimes.

All of which, makes me wonder ... what should I build a map of *next*?
