<!-- TEASER_END -->

There's a map for almost every occasion and [this map](https://submarine-cable-map-2013.telegeography.com/ "https://submarine-cable-map-2013.telegeography.com/") shows how the internet deals with those problematic moments when you run out of land to bury a cable in, with the added bonus that it's done in a rather nice retro style reminiscent of the [glorious maps of the 16th. Century](https://www.flickr.com/photos/normanbleventhalmapcenter/2709984325/in/set-72157609531154289 "https://www.flickr.com/photos/normanbleventhalmapcenter/2709984325/in/set-72157609531154289").
