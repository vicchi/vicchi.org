In October of 2012, whilst sorting through my father's personal effects, I was proud to find that I wasn't the first map nerd in the family and that [maps seemed to mean as much to my Dad](/2012/10/05/map-nature-or-map-nuture-are-map-addicts-born-or-made/ "/2012/10/05/map-nature-or-map-nuture-are-map-addicts-born-or-made/") as they do to me.

Lumped in with my father's posessions were also some things from my childhood which my parents had kept, either for sentimental reasons or in the hope that one day, I might have children who might want some of my toys, books and games.

At the weekend, I had another clear out and came across some jigsaws I had when I was around 8 or so years old.

Maps jigsaws from the early 1970's of Australia, the US, India and the UK; maybe I was a map nerd even as a child and just didn't know it then.
