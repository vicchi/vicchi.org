It's taken a while but after 20 commits on GitHub, 1000 odd lines of PHP code, 40 odd WordPress [forum posts](https://wordpress.org/tags/wp-biographia?forum_id=10 "https://wordpress.org/tags/wp-biographia?forum_id=10") and, what to me is a staggering, [1100 odd WordPress downloads](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-biographia/stats/ "https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-biographia/stats/"), WP Biographia finally hits [version 2.0](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-biographia/changelog/ "https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-biographia/changelog/"). As I've written before, this is very much an ongoing learning process and putting version 2.0 out into the wild hasn't been entirely trouble free, as this [thread on the WordPress forums](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-biographia-ouch-update-deleted-all-user-avatars "https://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-biographia-ouch-update-deleted-all-user-avatars") amply shows.

But despite the initial teething problems, version 2.0 is out and the list of enhancements and fixes remains unchanged from the beta version, but the official version 2.0 release of this plugin is now both on [GitHub](https://github.com/vicchi/wp-biographia "https://github.com/vicchi/wp-biographia") and the [WordPress plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-biographia/ "https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-biographia/") and while my [Codeage](/pages/codeage/wp-biographia/ "/pages/codeage/wp-biographia/") page still remains the official home for this plugin, there's a nicer looking home on [GitHub for WP Biographia](https://vicchi.github.com/wp-biographia/ "https://vicchi.github.com/wp-biographia/") courtesy of GitHub's pages feature.

The vast majority of those 1100 odd WordPress downloads are thanks to the WordPress community itself, who've had some nice things to say about WP Biographia, such as Kevin Muldoon on [wpmods.com](https://www.wpmods.com/wp-biographia-wordpress-plugin/ "https://www.wpmods.com/wp-biographia-wordpress-plugin/")  ...



> As you will have established by now, I think WP Biographia is a great little plugin. Being able to insert the author box directly into an RSS feed will benefit anyone who runs a multi-author blog or website (or those who accept guest posts regularly). The plugin also adds new social media profile fields to users profile and displays them in the author box automatically.
> 
> I encourage you to try it out yourselves and see what the plugin can do.


... and on Smashing Magazine's [noupe.com](https://www.noupe.com/wordpress/25-useful-free-wordpress-plugins-for-multi-author-blogs.html "https://www.noupe.com/wordpress/25-useful-free-wordpress-plugins-for-multi-author-blogs.html") ...

> Arguably the best looking author bio plugin available for WordPress, WP Biographia gives you complete control over what is shown in the bio area and adds Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+ profile fields to every users profile. You can choose whether the box is shown on posts, pages, archives and/or the home page and you can customise the colour scheme and border too.
> 
> Without a doubt the plugins best feature is the ability to display author bios in the RSS feed. 99% of blogs don’t include a link to the authors posts or website through their RSS feed therefore the guest poster loses a lot of potential traffic from RSS readers. WP Biographia corrects this by displaying a beautiful looking bio at the end of every post in the RSS feed.

> Authors like credit. Make sure you are using this plugin so everybody knows who the writer is. Adds Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google Plus profiles, but the real killer feature is that it works in RSS feeds.


A next version of WP Biographia, which will probably end up as v2.1 is now in the works, which includes some of the additional feature requests that people have asked for on the WordPress forums as well as directly by email. Trying to keep the usual home life, work life, coding life balance in check means that quite when v2.1 will see the light of day is unclear and as the Christmas Holiday season is fast approaching it may well be sometime in early 2012, but only time will tell.
