Here's a simple, cut-out-and-keep recipe for making a very geeked out update on a cartographical classic. First, take a classic and iconic map which appeals to both the map geek in you as well as the Tube geek in you. Harry Beck's 1931 reworking of the map of the [London Underground](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_map "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_map") system will do nicely.

Next, take a classic, 1980's movie which appeals to both the scifi fan and the computer nerd in you and classifies as a guilty pleasure as an added bonus. Disney's 1981 [Tron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(film) "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(film)") fits the bill here.

Add the ingredients, mix well and serve. The end results might just look like [Kevin Flynn's](http://iamclu.deviantart.com/ "http://iamclu.deviantart.com/") version of the London Underground network on The Grid.

To paraphrase Kevin Flynn (the Tron character not the artist) ... "*Who's that guy?*", "*That's Tron. He fights for the Tube Users*".
