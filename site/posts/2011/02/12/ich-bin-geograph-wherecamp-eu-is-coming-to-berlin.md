In March 2010, [Chris Osborne](http://twitter.com/osbornec "http://twitter.com/osbornec") and [myself](http://twitter.com/vicchi "http://twitter.com/vicchi") transplanted the post-Where 2.0 WhereCamp from Silicon Valley and brought it to London. Judging by the [feedback and comments](http://vtny.org/F0 "http://vtny.org/F0") we got during and after the event, it was a geotastic success and showed that Europe had an appetite for a 2 day, free, unconference on all matters geo. After a brief northbound sojourn as [WhereCamp UK](http://vtny.org/F1 "http://vtny.org/F1") in November 2010, we're happy to announce that WhereCamp EU is back for 2011 and with a distinctly European flavour.

Whilst the venue is yet to be confirmed, WhereCamp EU will be taking place on the [27th and 28th of May in Berlin](http://vtny.org/EZ "http://vtny.org/EZ").

We'll keep you posted with more details on the WhereCamp EU [blog](http://wherecamp.eu/ "http://wherecamp.eu/") , on [Lanyrd](http://vtny.org/F2 "http://vtny.org/F2") and on our [Twitter](http://twitter.com/wherecampeu "http://twitter.com/wherecampeu") feed.

"Ich Bin Geograph" (as Google translate tells me).
