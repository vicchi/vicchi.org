In May of this year, Nokia announced the [retirement of the Ovi brand](http://conversations.nokia.com/2011/05/16/the-evolution-of-nokia-and-ovi/ "http://conversations.nokia.com/2011/05/16/the-evolution-of-nokia-and-ovi/") and the observant map watchers amongst you may have noticed that pointing your browser of choice at [maps.ovi.com](http://maps.ovi.com "http://maps.ovi.com") now automagically redirects you to the new, shiny [maps.nokia.com](http://maps.nokia.com/ "http://maps.nokia.com/").

... places. And it's not just iOS devices that the new Mobile Web maps supports, Android users can have this too as can Blackberry users.

That's not just geo-tastic, it's geo-egalitarian.
