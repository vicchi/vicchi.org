Since I started my role at Nokia in Berlin in May of last year I've swapped the daily commute from home to work by train to a weekly commute by plane. This means I have to pass through airport security at London's Heathrow and Berlin's Tegel airports around twice a week. I tend to travel as light as I can, with a hand baggage sized suitcase so I can get off the plane and out of the airport as quickly as I possibly can, something [Tegel airport excels at](/2010/07/30/berlins-tegel-airport-from-plane-to-taxi-in-under-a-minute/ "/2010/07/30/berlins-tegel-airport-from-plane-to-taxi-in-under-a-minute/").

Taking the law of averages into account, I should be subject to random additional security searches and although the law of averages is generally considered a fallacy, about once a month my hand baggage gets that *extra special* level of attention. But it always seems to be for the same thing.

The security staff at Tegel are terribly polite and ask me in the nicest way possible whether I wouldn't mind if they took a look in my suitcase (of course, although it's phrased in a way that appears I have a choice in the matter, I really don't). Whereas the staff at Heathrow are a lot more brusque, with the conversation much more along the lines of "*open your suitcase please Sir*".

At Tegel, the security staff at least tell me what they think we're looking for ... "*do you have a can of drink in your suitcase?*" ... something I don't try to carry onto a plane as it's not permitted under the current "[100 ml of liquids and gels in a clear plastic ziplock bag](https://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Publictransport/AirtravelintheUK/DG_078179 "https://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Publictransport/AirtravelintheUK/DG_078179")" rule. At Heathrow, they merely frown and poke around in my luggage.

So at both airports, the X-Ray machine seems to show a can of drink in my suitcase. But why? Each time this has happened the root cause is the same; a small, rectangular plastic box which holds my spare business cards, which when found in my suitcase elicits a confused frown, a brief inspection and muttered apologies and I'm sent on my way, sometimes with a "*have a good flight*" (Tegel) or a curt "*thank you*" (Heathrow).

I wish I could understand why a small, rectangular object should be mistaken for a significantly larger, cylindrical object under airport security X-Ray, but I can't. Oddly enough, this never seems to happen with airport security in the US; maybe they have different X-Ray machines.
