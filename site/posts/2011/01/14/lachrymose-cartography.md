After [yesterday's admittedly bleak look](/2011/01/13/just-because-you-can-put-something-on-a-map/ "/2011/01/13/just-because-you-can-put-something-on-a-map/") at how not to use a map, I thought it worthwhile to look at a far more upbeat use of a map. This particular gem has been doing the rounds for a long long time, but I've no idea where it originated from (if you know, then please let me know in the comments).

As a map it's a fairly simple affair, inspired by Andrew Lloyd Webber's and Tim Rice's 1978 musical [Evita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evita_(musical) "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evita_(musical)"), showing which countries should and which countries shouldn't [cry for you](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Cry_for_Me_Argentina "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Cry_for_Me_Argentina").

So now you know.
