<h1 class="text-xxl font-black -leading-tight tracking-normal dark:text-gray-200 md:text-3xl text-center">Hello ... I'm Gary</h1>

<img src="/assets/images/gary.jpg" />
 A self-professed geek and map addict, I've worked in the mapping and location space for over ~~25~~30 years through a combination of luck and occasional good judgement. I'm currently CTO with [Kamma](https://www.kammadata.com), a growing #geotech, #proptech and #regtech company based in London's legal district.

When I'm not in an office or hybrid working from home, I work from anywhere with the magic combination of good coffee, free Wi-Fi and somewhere to charge my MacBook Pro.

Previously I've been CTO of [what3words](https://what3words.com/), Head of APIs for the [Ordnance Survey](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/), the United Kingdom's national mapping agency, the Geotechnologist-in-residence for [Lokku](https://lokku.com/), was Director of Places and Director of Global Community Programs for Nokia Maps and [HERE Maps](https://www.here.com/). Before joining Nokia I led Yahooâ€™s UK [Geo Technologies](https://developer.yahoo.com/boss/geo/) group, launching [GeoPlanet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoPlanet), Placemaker, helping [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) and [Fire Eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Eagle) do location based services and have even worked at the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESRIN), a job which really was rocket science.

I'm based in London, where I live with my family in Teddington. A commited Italophile, I'm also a science fiction fan who thinks that removing Deckard's noir voiceover from Blade Runner was utterly the right thing to do. Our house runs on Macs and macOS (because it's basically UNIX with a lovely user interface) and Raspberry Pi's; although an X-Box and Windows laptop have managed to creep in.

I've been tweeting as [@vicchi](https://twitter.com/vicchi) since 2007, which has now been mostly supplanted by "tooting" as [@vicchi@mapstodon.space](@vicchi@mapstodon.space) and writing here at [www.vicchi.org](https://www.vicchi.org) since 2001. I'm the creator of the [Vaguely Rude Places Map](https://www.vaguelyrudeplacesmap.com/) and also put [Yahoo's WOEIDs](https://woeplanet.org/) back online.
