<h2><a name="description"></a>Description</h2>

The ribbon graphic links to an <a href="https://secure.38degrees.org.uk/page/s/stop-government-snooping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online petition</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.38degrees.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">38 Degrees</a>.

<h2><a name="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>How do I get help or support for this plugin?</h3>
In short, very easily. But before you read any further, take a look at <a href="/2012/03/31/asking-for-wordpress-plugin-help-and-support-without-tears/">Asking For WordPress Plugin Help And Support Without Tears</a> before firing off a question. In order of preference, you can ask a question on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/tags/wp-stop-cdb?forum_id=10">WordPress support forum</a>; this is by far the best way so that other users can follow the conversation. You can ask me a question on Twitter; I'm <a href="http://twitter.com/vicchi">@vicchi</a>. Or you can drop me an email instead. I can't promise to answer your question but I do promise to answer and do my best to help.
<h3>Is there a web site for this plugin?</h3>
Absolutely. Go to the <a href="/pages/codeage/wp-stop-cdb/">WP Stop UK Communications Data Bill Ribbon home page</a> for the latest information. There's also the official <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-stop-cdb/">WordPress plugin repository page</a> and the <a href="http://vicchi.github.com/wp-stop-cdb/">source for the plugin is on GitHub</a> as well.
<h3>Can I change the wording on the ribbon graphic?</h3>
Not at the moment, no. If you want to create your own ribbon graphic, there's a blank template image, located in <code>images/template-ribbon.png</code> that you can use as a starting point. The best way of implementing this would have been for me to build the ribbon graphic purely in CSS, which is possible using the latest CSS browser extensions, but this doesn't work consistently across all browsers nor is it supported across the widest possible range of browsers.
<h3>Can I change the URL that the ribbon graphic links to?</h3>
Not at the moment, no. At least not without changing the source code of the plugin; look for the definition of the <code>WPSTOPCDB_LINK_URL</code> constant in <code>wp-stop-cdb.php</code> at around line 31. This may be a configurable option in a future release of the plugin.
<h3>I want to amend/hack/augment this plugin; can I do this?</h3>
