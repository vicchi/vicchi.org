<html><body><p>This is my personal blog; I write it in my spare time and I maintain it at my own expense.

Though I may occasionally talk about issues that touch on my work, this is not a corporate blog andÂ <strong><em>the opinions and ideas expressed here are absolutely just my own, and should not be confused with, or taken for, those of my employers</em></strong>, Nokia, Nokia Location and Commerce and Nokia Gate5 GmbH. It's just me, OK?

(Thanks to <a href="http://andrewlewin.wordpress.com/">Andrew Lewin</a>, whose disclaimer I've based mine on).</p></body></html>
